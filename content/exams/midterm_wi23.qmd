## Rules

1.  Your solutions must be written up in the R Markdown (Rmd) file called `midterm-01.Rmd`. This file must include your code and write up (written explanation) for each task.

2.  Be sure to knit your file to HTML prior to submission and include both the .Rmd and .html files on GitHub. Your "submission" will be whatever is in your exam repository at the deadline.

3.  If you cannot figure out the code for a question and this is causing you to not be able to knit your file, set the code chunk to `eval = FALSE` (but leave your code there - chance for partial credit!) and then knit.

4.  This exam is open book, open internet, closed other people. You may use any online or book-based resource you would like, but you must include citations for any code that you use. You **may not** consult with anyone else about this exam, including any other humans on the internet or one another.

5.  You have until **11:59pm on Monday, Feb 13th** to complete this exam and turn it in via your personal Github repo - late work will not be accepted. Technical difficulties are **not** an excuse for late work - do not wait until the last minute to knit / commit / push.

6.  There will be no Campuswire posts about questions on the exam. If you are unsure of something, include a note in your exam. We'll consider this in grading. However, if you think there is a mistake in the exam or are having technical issues, please DM or email Prof Ellis as soon as possible.

7.  Each question requires a (brief) narrative as well as a (brief) description of your approach. You can use comments in your code, but do not extensively count on these. I should be able to suppress **all** the code in your document and still be able to read and make sense of your answers to the questions.

8.  Even if the answer seems obvious from the R output, make sure to state it in your narrative as well. For example, if the question is asking what is 2 + 2, and you have the following in your document, you should additionally have a sentence that states "2 + 2 is 4." You just want us to be clear that you know the answer to the question.

``` r
2 + 2
# 4
```

## Academic Integrity 

Be sure to complete the AI statement in the exam you submit itself.

**A note on sharing / reusing code:** I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. For this exam you are allowed to make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). You are also not allowed to ask a question on an external forum, you can only use answers to questions that have already been answered. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. All communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

## Grading and feedback

This exam is worth 14% of your grade. You will be graded on the correctness of your code, correctness of your answers, the clarity of your explanations, and the overall organization of your document. (There's no one "right" organization but the template gets you started on a well-organized exam. We should be able to easily navigate your midterm to find what we're looking for.) **Organization + Clarity in written communication - 1pt**

## Logistics

Answer the questions in the document called `midterm-01.Rmd`. Add your code and narrative in the spaces below each question. Add code chunks as needed. Use as many lines as you need, but keep your narrative concise. Be sure to knit your file to HTML and view the file prior to turning it in.

## Packages

You will need the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels` packages for this midterm. If working on datahub, these package has been installed, but you will need to load them. You are allowed, but not required, to use additional packages.

## The data

The data we'll be using come from The [Axios and Harris Poll](https://www.axios.com/2022/05/24/2022-axios-harris-poll-100-rankings) and have been provided by the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-05-31) team.

The data are stored in two different files in the `data/` folder: `poll.csv` and `reputation.csv`. You'll want to read each table in and understand what each variable represents prior to completing the exam.

Each variable and the data overall are described in detail [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-05-31#data-dictionary). You should click on that link to see what information is stored in each column in the datasets. But briefly, these two files include data about the 100 "most visible" brands in America. Specifically, `reputation.csv` includes information from the 2022 poll about these 100 stores across different reputation categories. `poll.csv` includes information about the same 100 stores but includes information about their rankings across multiple years.

## Questions

### Question 1 (0.5 points)

How many different industries (`industry` variable) are represented in these data?

### Question 2 (0.5 points)

a)  Which company had the lowest overall ranking in 2022?
b)  And for which category (from the `name` variable) did this organization score lowest?

### Question 3 (1 point)

Which company in the `reputation.csv` dataset has the "best" average (mean) rank across all seven categories?

### Question 4 (1 point)

Which company had the biggest increase in rank from 2021 to 2022?

### Question 5 (1.5 points)

For the industry with only a single "most visible" company in the dataset, has their RQ score been increasing or decreasing overall since 2017?

### Question 6 (2 points)

How many companies from each `industry` category are represented in the 2022 '100 Most Visible' companies in America data? Generate a visualization to display the answer to this question. Be sure to follow best visualization practices discussed in class.

### Question 7 (2 points)

Of industries that have at least 5 companies in the dataset, which industry has the highest median 2022 rank? Generate a visualization that allows you to answer this question. Be sure to follow best practices.

### Question 8 (2 points)

Your boss is curious about how much rankings change from one year to the next. To answer this question, they ask you to determine how well 2021 rankings explain the following year's 2022 rankings. Generate a linear model to answer this question. Be sure to include your interpretation of the model (in other words your answer to the question "how well do 2021 rankings explain 2022's rankings?")

### Question 9 (2.5 points)

Recreate the plot included below using the data you've been working with. Once you have created the visualization, in no more than one paragraph, describe what you think the point of this visualization might be.
