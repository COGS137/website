## Rules

There will be rules spelled out on the real midterm. Be sure to read them before taking the real exam. There will also be an academic integrity statement for you to complete. Replace the `____________` with your name below on the real deal.

::: callout-note
This is the midterm from the last time this course was offered. Linear regression was not covered prior to the midterm the last time this course was offered. There *will* be a question or two on linear regression and the interpretation of linear models on this year's midterm.
:::

## Academic Integrity Statement

I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, hereby state that I have not communicated with or gained information in any way from my classmates or anyone during this exam, and that all work is my own.

**A note on sharing / reusing code:** We are well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. For this exam you are allowed to make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). You are also not allowed to ask a question on an external forum, you can only use answers to questions that have already been answered. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. All communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

## Getting help

Because we cannot be available to all students across the entire length of the (real) exam, there will be no questions of instructional staff about the exam. If you find wording confusing or are unsure, note that in your answer and explain how you interpreted it. This will be taken into consideration during grading. If you are having technical difficulties or think there is an error on the exam, DM or email Prof Ellis immediately and she'll work with you as soon as possible.

## Grading and feedback

The (real) exam is worth 16% of your grade. You will be graded on the correctness of your code, correctness of your answers (often there are multiple "correct" answers, by design), the clarity of your explanations, and the overall organization of your document. (There's no one "right" organization, but we should be able to easily navigate your midterm to find what we're looking for.)

## Logistics

Answer the questions in the document called `practice-exam.Rmd`. Add your code and narrative in the spaces below each question. Add code chunks as needed. Use as many lines as you need, but keep your narrative concise. Be sure to knit your file to HTML and view the file prior to turning it in.

## Packages

You will need the `tidyverse` package for this (practice) midterm. (For the real deal, you'll need `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`.) If working on datahub, this package has been installed, but you will need to load it. No other packages are required, but if for some reason you want to load in another package, you are permitted to do so.

## The data

The dataset you'll be working with on this practice midterm is all about beach volleyball. The full dataset is explained in detail [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-19/readme.md) and includes match-level data from 76,756 volleyball matches. **You should click on that link to see what information is stored in each column in this dataset and what information is included in each column.**

Briefly, what you'll use for this midterm is a subset of the full dataset, including only the 11,699 observations (rows) from 2018 and 2019 but all of the original columns. Each row summarizes the results from a *single, distinct match* played in a volleyball tournament.

To briefly describe beach volleyball, it is a sport played 2 on 2, so each match involves only 4 players. These data include matches from two different volleyball `circuit`s, the international FIVB and the US-centric AVP. You will not need to know much at all about this sport to complete this midterm, and anything you need to know will be explained.

The data are stored in `data/vb_matches.csv`. You'll need to read the dataset in prior to answering any questions on the midterm.

## Questions

**Question 1 (0.75 points)** - How many FIVB and AVP matches are included in this dataset?

**Question 2 (0.75 points)** - Find the match with the longest duration.

    a.  Where was this tournament played (City & Country)?
    b.  How long did the match last?
    c.  Who were the two winners? </br>

**Question 3 (1.5 points)** - Across all tournaments included in this dataset, which teams have won the most tournaments? Your response should include both the winning players, their gender, and the number of tournaments they've won in descending order. Who has the most wins? How many men's and how many women's teams are in the top 10? Note: "winning a tournament" is indicated by winning either a "Gold Medal" (FIVB) or "Finals" (AVP) match, specified in the `bracket` column.

**Question 4 (1.5 points)** - Of *only* the AVP tournaments included in this dataset, how many *different* cities hosted tournaments in 2018 and 2019? And, which cities (if any) hosted a tournament in both 2018 and 2019? Note that `tournament`s are named for the city hosting the tournament.

**Question 5 (2.5 points)** - Prof Ellis plays a lot of women's beach volleyball and is only 5'5" (65 inches). Despite not having the sheer talent or raw athletic ability to make it as a professional volleyball player, she wonders if she ever had a chance at her height. (Reminder: there are 4 players in each match whose height should be considered.) To help her out, answer each of the following:

    a.  Who was the shortest women's player to compete in a tournament in 2018/2019?
    b.  How tall are they?
    c.  Did they *win* a tournament in 2018 or 2019? </br>

**Question 6 (3 points)** - Which country has hosted the most FIVB tournaments? Did this differ by year? Generate a visualization that shows how many *FIVB* tournaments each country hosted. Allow viewer to visualize this by year. And, be sure each tournament is only counted once (regardless of how many games were played).

**Question 7 (3 points)** - Recreate the plot included below using the data you've been working with. Once you have created the visualization, in no more than one paragraph, describe what you think the point of this visualization might be. (*Hint:* The visualization uses the variable `avg_team_height`, which is not included in the provided data frame. You will have to create `avg_team_height` yourself, by determining the average (mean) team height for each winning team.)

::: callout-note
Q7 had a typo when this course was offered previously leading to students spending wayyyyy longer than intended on this exam. That typo has been fixed for this practice midterm.
:::


**Question 8 (1 pts)** - If you were in charge of designing the plot you just recreated in the plot above, what changes would you make to improve its effectiveness as a visualization? (You do not have to write any code for this question, just explain the different design/viz choices you would make.)
