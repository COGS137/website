# Lab 04: Modelling course evals (Pt. 1) {background-color="#0E3A53"}

## Agenda

1. Lab 04: Modelling course evaluations
2. Getting started with lab

## Lab 06: Modelling course evaluations

- Many college courses give students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously

- The use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, e.g. the physical appearance of the instructor

## You've all seen something like this...

## Data comes from...

"Beauty in the classroom: instructorsâ€™ pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity"

## Some new challenges in this lab

- There isn't much code on the lab instructions, you might need to refer to course slides to put the pieces together, however most of the time 
    + you'll be visualizing with `ggplot`, 
    + fitting a model with `lm`, 
    + and viewing some model statistics with `glance`
- Interpretation *in the context of the data* matters
    + Numbers need context: saying (for example) "the $\beta_1$ is 5" isn't enough; what does that mean? In particular, what does that mean *for these data* and for *this question*
