## Agenda

1.  Describe what this class is
2.  Describe how the class will run
3.  Go over the tooling for this course: R, RStudio, GitHub

## What is R?

<i class="fa fa-code fa"></i> : R is a statistical programming language.

While R has most/all of the functionality of **YFPL** (your favorite programming language), it was designed for the specific use of analyzing data.

## What is data science?

<i class="fa fa-laptop fa-lg"></i>: Data science is the scientific process of using data to answer interesting questions and/or solve important problems.

## Practical Data Science in R

::: incremental
-   Program at the introductory level in the R statistical programming language
-   Employ the tidyverse suite of packages to interact with, wrangle, visualize, and model data
-   Explain & apply statistical concepts (estimation, linear regression, logistic regression, etc.) for data analysis
-   Communicate data science projects through effective visualization, oral presentation, and written reports

::: panel-tabset
### Lecture

**Class Meetings**

-   Interactive
-   Lectures & lots of learn-by-doing
-   Bring your laptop to class every day

### In-person

**In-person, synchronous learning**

1.  I will be teaching (so long as I'm healthy and have child care) in person.
2.  Lectures will be podcast.
3.  Attendance will be incentivized using a daily participation survey.
4.  If you're not feeling well, please stay home. I will do the same.
5.  Exam will be take-home.

### Waitlist

**The (Dreaded) Waitlist**

-   Course enrollment is supposed to be 50 for this course
-   There are 72 people currently enrolled
-   I don't control the waitlist (cogsadvising\@ucsd.edu does)
-   I'd anticipate our staff adding 3-5 people from the waitlist (but cannot guarantee this)

### Lab & OH

**Lab & Office Hours**

-   My office hours begin week 1; TA/IA OH begin week 2
-   Lab will start this Fri (week 1)
-   I will hang out after class today for questions/concerns from students

### Materials

**Course Materials**

-   Textbooks are free and available online
-   Course platforms:
    -   Website : schedule, policies, due dates, etc.
    -   GitHub : retrieving assignments, labs, exams, etc.
    -   datahub : completing assignments, labs, exams etc.
    -   Gradescope : submitting assignments
    -   Canvas : grades, course-specific links
    -   Campuswire : Q&A
:::

## Diversity & Inclusion:

**Goal**: every student be well-served by this course

. . .

**Philosophy:** The diversity of students in this class is a huge asset to our learning community; our differences provide opportunities for learning and understanding.

. . .

**Plan:** Present course materials that are conscious of and respectful to diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, politics, and culture)

. . .

**But...** if I ever fall short or if you ever have suggestions for improvement, please do share with me! There is also an [anonymous Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/2nXnDNbgYuS1OsGF2) if you're more comfortable there.

## A new-ish course! {.scrollable}

-   Offered once previously
-   If something doesn't make sense, tell me!
-   If you've got feedback/suggestions, I'm all ears!

. . .

Differences since last iteration:

-   Less...pretty much everything
-   New website/lecture platform (quarto)
-   Tu/Th and not early in the morning
-   Group mates differ
-   Increased focus on communication
-   Multiple final project options
-   Slightly larger class & slightly smaller staff
-   I'm a mom & just coming back from parental leave

## How to get help {.scrollable}

-   Lab
-   Office Hours
-   Campuswire

. . .

A few guidelines:

    1. No duplicates.
    2. Public posts are best.
    3. Posts should include your question, what you've tried so far, & resources used.
    4. Helping others is encouraged.
    5. No assignment code in public posts.
    6. We're not robots.

## Academic integrity

Don't cheat.

. . .

Teamwork is allowed, but you should be able to answer "Yes" to each of the following: - Can I explain each piece of code and each analysis carried out in what I'm submitting? - Could I reproduce this code/analysis on my own?

. . .

The Internet is a great resource. - Cite your sources.

. . .

Teamwork is *not* allowed on your midterm. - It is open-notes and open-Google - You cannot discuss the questions on the exam with anyone.

## Course components:

::: incremental
-   <font color="#ABC57D">Labs (8)</font>: Individual submission; graded on effort
-   <font color="#ABC57D">Homework (4)</font>: Individual submission; graded on correctness

-   <font color="#ABC57D">Case Studies (2)</font>: Team submission, technical analysis report
-   <font color="#ABC57D">Final Project (1) </font>: Team submission, due Thurs of finals week
:::

## Grading

Your final grade will be comprised of the following:

| Assignment (#)            | \% of grade |

| Labs (8)                  | 16%         |
| Homework (4)              | 32%         |
| Midterm (1)               | 15%         |
| Case Study Projects\* (2) | 20%         |
| Final project\* (1)       | 17%         |

\* indicates group submission

## Late/missed work policy

-   Homework and case study projects: accepted up to 3 days (72 hours) after the assigned deadline for a 25% deduction

-   No late deadlines for labs, the exam, or the final project

. . .

-   Note: Prof Ellis is a reasonable person; reach out to her if you have an extenuating circumstance at any point in the quarter.

# Tooling {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Datahub

Datahub is a platform hosted by UCSD that gives students access to computational resources.

This means that while you'll be typing on your keyboard, you'll be *using* UCSD's computers in this class.

Website: <https://datahub.ucsd.edu/>

. . .

**Launch Environment**

When working on "stuff" for this course, select the COGS 137 environment.

![datahub](images/00/datahub.png)

## Toolkit

![toolkit](images/00/toolkit.png)

-   Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R

-   Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown

-   Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

## R and RStudio {.scrollable}

::: panel-tabset
### R/RStudio

**R & RStudio**

-   R is a statistical programming language
-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integreated development environment, IDE)

### Tour

<center>\[DEMO\]</center>

Concepts introduced:

-   Console
-   Using R as a calculator
-   Environment
-   Loading and viewing a data frame
-   Accessing a variable in a data frame
-   R functions

### Try

**Your Turn**

1.  Login to datahub
2.  Carry out a mathematical operation in the console
3.  View the `airquality` dataframe
4.  Access a column from the `airquality` dataframe
5.  Calculate the median for one of the numeric columns

Put a <font color="#32cb31">green</font> sticky on the front of your computer when you're done. Put a <font color="#ff65a3">pink</font> if you want help/have a question.

### R packages

-   **Packages** are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data [^1]
-   As of Jan 2023, there are \~18,979 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)[^2]
-   We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!

<center><a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse.org</a></center>

-   The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.
-   All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common syntax.
:::

## RStudio Projects[^3]

[^3]: [RStudio Projects Documentation](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)

-   Built-in functionality to keep all files for a single project organized

## R Markdown

-   Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit, the document is executed from top to bottom
-   Simple markdown syntax for text
-   Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

## R Markdown tips

-   Keep the [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) and Markdown Quick Reference (Help -\> Markdown Quick Reference) handy, we'll refer to it often as the course progresses

-   The workspace of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console

<br><br>

<center>\[DEMO\]</center>

## How will we use R Markdown?

-   Every lab / project / homework / notes / etc. is an R Markdown document
-   You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the quarter

## Collaboration: Git & GitHub

-   The statistical programming language we'll use is R
-   The software we use to interface with R is RStudio
-   But how do I get you the course materials that you can build on for your assignments?
    -   Hint: I'm not going to email you documents, that would be a mess!

## Version control

-   We introduced GitHub as a platform for collaboration
-   But it's much more than that...
-   It's actually designed for version control

## Versioning

![Lego versions](images/00/lego-steps.png)

## Versioning

with human readable messages

![Lego versions with commit messages](images/00/lego-steps-commit-messages.png)

## Why do we need version control?

![PhD Comics](images/00/phd_comics_vc.gif)

## Git and GitHub tips {.scrollable}

-   Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word on steroids. GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better).

. . .

-   There are millions of git commands -- ok, that's an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them -- and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

. . .

-   We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.

Resource: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/): book for working with git in R; Some content is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good resource
:::

## Let's take a tour -- Git / GitHub

**We'll cover this time permitting, you'll see it again in lab this week**

Concepts introduced:

-   Connect an R project to Github repository
-   Working with a local and remote repository
-   Committing, Pushing and Pulling

There is a bit more of GitHub that we'll use in this class, but for today this is enough.

## Recap

Can you answer these questions?

-   What is R vs RStudio?
-   What are RStudio Projects?
-   What is version control, and why do we care?
-   What is git vs GitHub (and do I need to care)?
