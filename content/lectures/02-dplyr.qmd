## Q&A {.scrollable .smaller}

> Q: what does `|>` mean?  
A: It means "and then" and is called a "pipe." Discussing this in more detail in today's lecture!

> Q: I think the lab is much more harder than the lecture.  
A: This first week there is a lot to learn regarding tooling, but once you've got that down the "process" of completing a lab will become second nature. Then, it's just content...and applying something is always more difficult than listening to it being explained. So, labs will be a bit harder than lecture...but that's by design b/c 1) we grade on effort (it's ok to be wrong in labs!) and 2) answer keys will be posted (learning from mistakes/places we struggle is a great way to learn!)

> Q: Just curious about the oral presentation portion of the final project. Will this be a requirement in the form of a recorded video (like in COGS 108), or will we be presenting our project findings live in front of the class on the due date?  
A: There are going to be two options (most likely). A recording will *definitely* be an option. We're also hoping to have an option where you can come present live, to the instructional staff and any students who want to learn from one another. 

> Q: I am curious about the similarities and differences between both of Python and R!  
A: Very briefly, some similarities: both are object-oriented programming languages (although R is not *only* object-oriented); both are great for data analysis; differences: python arguably has a simpler syntax; R is, at its core, designed for statistical analysis so I'd argue it's better for that; Python is a general-programming language so it's arguablly better for software development; R has an implementation of the grammar of graphics, so I'd argue it's better for data visualization (but some would disagree).

> Q: How can I understand dataframes in R easier?  
A: With practice! Today's lecture, this week 2 lab, and your first hw will help you get additional practice. Then, we'll use them throughout the course and build your understanding.

> Q: For very large data sets, how would you be able to find every type coercion?  
A: Each column would have a single type. `glimpse()` would help you identify the type of each column. From there, you can edit any that are not what you wanted.

> Q: Where would be a good location to get some practice on most of the packages we will be using in this class?  
A: The labs and homeworks are one place. But, there are also exercises in the "textbook" for this class: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

> Q: How do we grasp Markdown easier?  
A: Trying things out and learning the basic rules. I would recommend starting with an RMarkdown document and just typing a sentence. Then knit to see what that looks like. Then, try to bold and italicize some text. Then try to add some headers. Then, add a bulleted list. Each time knitting to see the output. With that, you'll have most of the markdown you'll need! [reference for basics](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

> Q: I am still not sure whether this class focuses more on the programming aspect or the mathematical concepts   
A: Both! First 5 weeks, more programming; Last 5: combination of both are used, but new programming concepts aren't introduced a ton, so we focus on the stats while continuing to use what we learned the first five weeks!


> Q: Is there any rules for coercion?  
A: There are rules! Summarized [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/r-in-a/9781449358204/ch05s08.html)

> Q: When do we use R markdown?  
A: When completing labs, homework assignments, case studies, and likely on the final project. You can also take notes in RMarkdown, but that's up to you!

> Q: Never heard about `ggplot2`. I think everyone had already heard of it previously...  
A: While some students have, you're not alone! We'll have two lectures on this and get plenty of practice soon!

# Pipes {background-color="#92A86A"}

## The pipe in baseR

<p align="center">

<img src="images/02/baseR_hex.jpeg" width="300" height="300" align="center"/>

</p>

-   `|>` should be read as "and then"
-   for example "Wake up \|\> brush teeth" would be read as "wake up *and then* brush teeth"

## Where does the name come from?

The pipe operator was *first* implemented in the package **magrittr**.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/02/magritte.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/02/magrittr.jpg)
:::
:::

You will see this frequently in code online. It's equivalent to `|>`.

## Review: How does a pipe work? {.scrollable}

-   You can think about the following sequence of actions - find key, unlock car, start car, drive to school, park.

. . .

-   Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:

```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```

. . .

-   Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) structure:

```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") |>
  start_car() |>
  drive(to = "campus") |>
  park()
```

# Data {background-color="#92A86A"}

## NC DOT Fatal Crashes in North Carolina

From OpenDurham's Data Portal

```{r load-data-real,include=FALSE}
bike <- read_csv2("data/nc_bike_crash.csv", na = c("NA", "", "."))
```

```{r load-data-fake, eval=FALSE}
bike <- read_csv2("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COGS137/datasets/main/nc_bike_crash.csv", 
                  na = c("NA", "", "."))
```

## Variables

View the names of variables via

```{r}
names(bike)
```

## Viewing your data

-   In the Environment, click on the name of the data frame to view it in the data viewer (or use the `View` function)

-   Use the `glimpse` function to take a peek

```{r}
glimpse(bike)
```

# `dplyr` {background-color="#92A86A"}

## A Grammar of Data Manipulation {.smaller .scrollable}

**dplyr** is based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.

Single data frame functions / verbs:

-   `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
-   `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
-   `select`: pick columns by name
-   `pull`: grab a column as a vector
-   `rename`: rename specific columns
-   `arrange`: reorder rows
-   `mutate`: add new variables
-   `transmute`: create new data frame with variables
-   `distinct`: filter for unique rows
-   `sample_n` / `sample_frac`: randomly sample rows
-   `summarize`: reduce variables to values
-   ... (many more)

## **`dplyr`** rules for functions

1.  First argument is *always* a data frame

2.  Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame

3.  Always return a data frame

4.  Do not modify in place

5.  Performance via lazy evaluation

## Filter rows with `filter`

-   Select a subset of rows in a data frame.
-   Easily filter for many conditions at once.

## `filter`

for crashes in Durham County

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike |>
  filter(County == "Durham")
```

## `filter`

for crashes in Durham County where biker was \< 10 yrs old

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike |>
  filter(County == "Durham", Bike_Age < 10)
```

## Aside: real data is messy! {.scrollable}

[<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i>   What in the world does a `BikeAge_gr` of `10-Jun` or `15-Nov` mean?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

```{r}
bike |>
  group_by(BikeAge_Gr) |>
  summarize(crash_count = n())
```

## Careful data scientists clean up their data first!

-   We're going to need to do some text parsing to clean up these data
    -   `10-Jun` should be `6-10`
    -   `15-Nov` should be `11-15`

## Correct and overwrite `mutate` {.scrollable}

-   Remember we want to do the following in the `BikeAge_Gr` variable
    -   `10-Jun` should be `6-10`
    -   `15-Nov` should be `11-15`

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2,8|"

bike <- bike |>
  mutate(
    BikeAge_Gr = case_when(
      BikeAge_Gr == "10-Jun" ~ "6-10",
      BikeAge_Gr == "15-Nov" ~ "11-15",
      TRUE                   ~ BikeAge_Gr     # everything else
    )
  )
```

-   Note that we're overwriting existing data and columns, so be careful!
    -   But remember, it's easy to revert if you make a mistake since we didn't touch the raw data, we can always reload it and start over

## Check before you move on

Always check your changes and confirm code did what you wanted it to do

```{r}
bike |>
  group_by(BikeAge_Gr) |>
  summarize(count = n())
```

## `mutate` to add new variables

[<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i>   How is the new `alcohol` variable determined?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

```{r eval=FALSE}
bike |>
  mutate(alcohol = case_when(
    Bike_Alc_D == "No" & Drvr_Alc_D == "No"      ~ "No",
    Bike_Alc_D == "Yes" | Drvr_Alc_D == "Yes"    ~ "Yes",
    Bike_Alc_D == "Missing" & Drvr_Alc_D == "No" ~ "Missing",
    Bike_Alc_D == "No" & Drvr_Alc_D == "Missing" ~ "Missing"
  ))
```

## "Save" when you `mutate`

Most often when you define a new variable with `mutate` you'll also want to save the resulting data frame, often by writing over the original data frame.

```{r eval=FALSE}
bike <- bike |>
  mutate(alcohol = case_when(
    Bike_Alc_D == "No" & Drvr_Alc_D == "No"      ~ "No",
    Bike_Alc_D == "Yes" | Drvr_Alc_D == "Yes"    ~ "Yes",
    Bike_Alc_D == "Missing" & Drvr_Alc_D == "No" ~ "Missing",
    Bike_Alc_D == "No" & Drvr_Alc_D == "Missing" ~ "Missing"
  ))
```

## `transmute` to create a new dataset

You'll use this much less often than `mutate` but when you need it, you need it.

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike |> 
  transmute(ID = paste(FID, OBJECTID, sep = "-"))
```

## `mutate` vs. `transmute`

-   `mutate` adds new and keeps original
-   `transmute` adds new; drops existing

## Your Turn

How many accidents in our dataset required an ambulance ride (`AmbulanceR`) *and* had the `Crash_Type` "Bicyclist Lost Control - Mechanical Problems"?

## `slice` for certain row numbers

First five

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike |>
  slice(1:5)
```

## `slice` for certain row numbers

Last five

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"

last_row <- nrow(bike)
bike |>
  slice((last_row - 4):last_row)
```

## `select` to keep only the variables you mention

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike |>
  select(Crash_Loc, Hit_Run) |>
  table()
```

## or `select` to exclude variables

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike |>
  select(-OBJECTID)
```

## or `select` a range of variables

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike |>
  select(OBJECTID:Bike_Injur)
```

## `pull` to extract a column as a vector

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"

bike |>
  slice(1:6) |>
  pull(Location)
```

```{r}
bike |>
  slice(1:6) |>
  select(Location)
```

## The two `pull`s in your lives {.smaller .scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/02/hex-dplyr.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/02/Octocat.png)
:::
:::

-   Don't get `pull` happy when wrangling data! Only extract out variables if you truly need to, otherwise keep in data frame.

-   But always `r emo::ji("arrow_down")` `Pull` before starting your work when collaborating on GitHub.

## `rename` specific columns

Useful for correcting typos, and renaming to make variable names shorter and/or more informative

-   Original names:

```{r}
names(bike)
```

## `rename` specific columns

-   Rename `Speed_Limi` to `Speed_Limit`:

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike <- bike |>
  rename(Speed_Limit = Speed_Limi)
```

## Check before you move on {.scrollable}

Always check your changes and confirm code did what you wanted it to do

```{r}
names(bike)
```

## Your Turn

Your boss in Cumberland County gets overwhelmed by data easily, but he wants some data from you. He wants all bike accidents from his County, but he only wants to know the road's speed limit, the age of the biker, and to know if alcohol was involved. If you have time, mine as well make the column names very clear to your boss while you're at it...

## `summarize` to reduce variables to values

The values are summarized in a data frame

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2-3"

bike |>
  group_by(BikeAge_Gr) |>
  summarize(crash_count = n())
```

## and `arrange` to order rows

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "4"

bike |>
  group_by(BikeAge_Gr) |>
  summarize(crash_count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(crash_count))
```

## `count` to group by then count

```{r}
bike |>
  count(BikeAge_Gr)
```

[<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i>   If you wanted to arrange these in ascending order what would you add to the pipe?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

## Select rows with `sample_n` or `sample_frac`

-   `sample_n`: randomly sample 5 observations

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike_n5 <- bike |>
  sample_n(5, replace = FALSE)

dim(bike_n5)
```

-   `sample_frac`: randomly sample 20% of observations

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike_perc20 <- bike |>
  sample_frac(0.2, replace = FALSE)

dim(bike_perc20)
```

## `distinct` to filter for unique rows

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"

bike |> 
  select(County, City) |> 
  distinct() |> 
  arrange(County, City)
```

## `distinct` has a .keep_all parameter

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

bike |> 
  distinct(County, City, .keep_all = TRUE) |> 
  arrange(County, City)
```

# Factors {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Factors {.scrollable}

Factor objects are how R stores data for categorical variables (fixed numbers of discrete values).

```{r}
(x = factor(c("BS", "MS", "PhD", "MS")))
```

```{r}
glimpse(x)
```

```{r}
typeof(x)
```

## Returning to: Cat lovers {.scrollable}

Reading in the cat-lovers data...

```{r load-data-real-cats,include=FALSE}
cat_lovers <- read_csv("data/cat-lovers.csv")
```

```{r load-data-fake-cats, eval=FALSE}
cat_lovers <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COGS137/datasets/main/cat-lovers.csv")
```

## Read data in as character strings

```{r}
glimpse(cat_lovers)
```

## But coerce when plotting {.scrollable}

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(cat_lovers, mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Use `forcats` to manipulate factors {.scrollable}

```{r}
cat_lovers <- cat_lovers |>
  mutate(handedness = fct_relevel(handedness, 
                                  "right", "left", "ambidextrous"))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(cat_lovers, mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## `forcats` functionality <img src="images/01/hex-forcats.png" width="10%" align="left"/> {.scrollable}

-   R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. Historically, factors were much easier to work with than character vectors, so many base R functions automatically convert character vectors to factors.

-   factors are still useful when you have true categorical data, and when you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display. The goal of the forcats package is to provide a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors.
