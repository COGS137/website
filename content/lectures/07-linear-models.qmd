# Linear Models {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Q&A {.smaller}

> Q: Do you recommend review some statistics before attending lectures?\
> A: This is very much up to you. It certainly wouldn't hurt! There will be readings connected to each lecture; these are a great place to start. It can be helpful to work through these readings and the exercises either before or after lecture!

> Q: I am still not quite sure how to do HW part 2 and 3, do we download data into the folder, read the file, and plot it?\
> A: Yup! That's one approach. The other approach (if the data are not available for download) would be to create the dataset on your own, estimating the values as best you can from the plot and creating a dataframe/tibble containing that information directly in your code (similar to what you did in HW01)....and then plot from there.

## Agenda

-   Linear Models
    -   Quantitative Predictor
    -   Categorical Predictor (2 & \>2 levels)
    -   residuals
    -   data transformations

# `tidymodels` {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Data: Paris Paintings

```{r message=FALSE}
pp <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COGS137/datasets/main/paris_paintings.csv", 
               na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))
```

-   Number of observations: `r nrow(pp)`
-   Number of variables: `r ncol(pp)`

## Goal: Predict height from width

$$\widehat{height}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times width_{i}$$

```{r height-width-plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = pp, aes(x = Width_in, y = Height_in)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#8E2C90") + 
  labs(
    title = "Height vs. width of paintings",
    subtitle = "Paris auctions, 1764 - 1780",
    x = "Width (inches)",
    y = "Height (inches)"
  )
```

## `tidymodels`

-   NOT a core `tidyverse` package
-   follows the structure of a `tidyverse` package

```{r out.width="98%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/07/tidymodels.png")
```

```{r}
# should already be installed for you on datahub
library(tidymodels)
```

## Step 1: Specify model

```{r}
linear_reg()
```

## Step 2: Set model fitting *engine*

```{r}
linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("lm") # lm: linear model
```

## Step 3: Fit model & estimate parameters

... using **formula syntax**

```{r fit-model}
linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("lm") |>
  fit(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp)
```

## A closer look at model output

```{r ref.label="fit-model", echo=FALSE}
```

$$\widehat{height}_{i} = 3.6214 + 0.7808 \times width_{i}$$

## A tidy look at model output

```{r}
linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("lm") |>
  fit(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp) |>
  tidy()
```

$$\widehat{height}_{i} = 3.62 + 0.781 \times width_{i}$$

## Slope and intercept

$$\widehat{height}_{i} = 3.62 + 0.781 \times width_{i}$$

. . .

-   **Slope:** For each additional inch the painting is wider, the height is expected to be higher, on average, by 0.781 inches.

. . .

-   **Intercept:** Paintings that are 0 inches wide are expected to be 3.62 inches high, on average. (Does this make sense?)

. . .

## Correlation does not imply causation

Remember this when interpreting model coefficients

# Parameter Estimation {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Linear model with a single predictor

-   We're interested in $\beta_0$ (population parameter for the intercept) and $\beta_1$ (population parameter for the slope) in the following model:

$$\hat{y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x_{i}$$

. . .

-   Tough luck, you can't have them...

. . .

-   So we use sample statistics to estimate them:

$$\hat{y}_{i} = b_0 + b_1~x_{i}$$

## Least squares regression

-   The regression line minimizes the sum of squared residuals.

. . .

-   If $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$, then, the regression line minimizes $\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i^2$.

## Visualizing residuals

```{r vis-res-1, echo=FALSE}
m_ht_wt <- linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("lm") |>
  fit(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp)

ht_wt_fit_tidy <- tidy(m_ht_wt$fit) 
ht_wt_fit_aug  <- augment(m_ht_wt$fit) |>
  mutate(res_cat = ifelse(.resid > 0, TRUE, FALSE))

p <- ggplot(data = ht_wt_fit_aug, 
            aes(x = Width_in, y = Height_in)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  labs(
    title = "Height vs. width of paintings",
    subtitle = "Just the data",
    x = "Width (inches)",
    y = "Height (inches)"
    ) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 250), ylim = c(0, 200)) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = "#E48957", face = "bold", size = rel(1.5)))
p
```

## Visualizing residuals (cont.)

```{r vis-res-2, echo=FALSE}
p <- p + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#E48957", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = .fitted), color = "#E48957") +
  labs(subtitle = "Data + least squares line")
p
```

## Visualizing residuals (cont.)

```{r vis-res-3, echo = FALSE}
p + 
  geom_segment(mapping = aes(xend = Width_in, yend = .fitted), color = "#E48957", alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(subtitle = "Data + least squares line + residuals")
```

## Properties of least squares regression

-   The regression line goes through the center of mass point, the coordinates corresponding to average $x$ and average $y$, $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$:

$$\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \bar{x} ~ \rightarrow ~ b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}$$

. . .

-   The slope has the same sign as the correlation coefficient: $b_1 = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$

. . .

-   The sum of the residuals is zero: $\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i = 0$

. . .

-   The residuals and $x$ values are uncorrelated

# Prediction with models {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Predict height from width

. . .

```{r}
3.62 + 0.78 * 60
```

"On average, we expect paintings that are 60 inches wide to be 50.42 inches high."

**Warning:** We "expect" this to happen, but there will be some variability. (We'll learn about measuring the variability around the prediction later.)

## Prediction vs. extrapolation

[`r emo::ji("question")` On average, how tall are paintings that are 400 inches wide? $$\widehat{Height_{in}} = 3.62 + 0.78~Width_{in}$$]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

```{r extrapolate, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.75}
newdata <- tibble(Width_in = 400)
newdata <- newdata |>
  mutate(Height_in = predict(m_ht_wt, new_data = newdata))

ggplot(data = pp, aes(x = Width_in, y = Height_in)) +

## Watch out for extrapolation!

> "When those blizzards hit the East Coast this winter, it proved to my satisfaction that global warming was a fraud. That snow was freezing cold. But in an alarming trend, temperatures this spring have risen. Consider this: On February 6th it was 10 degrees. Today it hit almost 80. At this rate, by August it will be 220 degrees. So clearly folks the climate debate rages on."[^1] <br> Stephen Colbert, April 6th, 2010

# Measuring model fit {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Measuring the strength of the fit

-   The strength of the fit of a linear model is most commonly evaluated using $R^2$.

-   It tells us what percent of variability in the response variable is explained by the model.

-   The remainder of the variability is explained by variables not included in the model.

-   $R^2$ is sometimes called the coefficient of determination.

## Obtaining $R^2$ in R {.smaller}

-   Height vs. width

```{r}
glance(m_ht_wt)
glance(m_ht_wt)$r.squared # extract R-squared
```

Roughly 68% of the variability in heights of paintings can be explained by their widths.

[`r emo::ji("question")`What's the unit of residuals?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

## Transforming the data

-   We saw that `price` has a right-skewed distribution, and the relationship between price and width of painting is non-linear.

. . .

-   In these situations a transformation applied to the response variable may be useful.

. . .

-   In order to decide which transformation to use, we should examine the distribution of the response variable.

. . .

-   The extremely right skewed distribution suggests that a log transformation may be useful.
    -   log = natural log, $ln$
    -   Default base of the `log` function in R is the natural log: <br> `log(x, base = exp(1))`

## Logged price vs. width

[`r emo::ji("question")` How do we interpret the slope of this model?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = pp_wt_lt_100, mapping = aes(x = Width_in, y = log(price))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#8E2C90", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Width (in)", y = "Log(price) (log livres)")
```

## Interpreting models with log transformation {.smaller}

```{r}
m_lprice_wt <- lm(log(price) ~ Width_in, data = pp_wt_lt_100)
m_lprice_wt |>
  tidy() |>
  select(term, estimate) |>
  mutate(estimate = round(estimate, 3))
```

## Linear model with log transformation

$$ \widehat{log(price)} = 4.67 + 0.02 Width $$

. . .

-   For each additional inch the painting is wider, the log price of the painting is expected to be higher, on average, by 0.02 livres.

. . .

-   which is not a very useful statement...

## Working with logs

-   Subtraction and logs: $log(a) − log(b) = log(a / b)$

. . .

-   Natural logarithm: $e^{log(x)} = x$

. . .

-   We can use these identities to "undo" the log transformation

## Interpreting models with log transformation

The slope coefficient for the log transformed model is 0.02, meaning the log price difference between paintings whose widths are one inch apart is predicted to be 0.02 log livres.

. . .

$$ log(\text{price for width x+1}) - log(\text{price for width x}) = 0.02 $$

. . .

$$ log\left(\frac{\text{price for width x+1}}{\text{price for width x}}\right) = 0.02 $$

. . .

$$ e^{log\left(\frac{\text{price for width x+1}}{\text{price for width x}}\right)} = e^{0.02} $$

. . .

$$ \frac{\text{price for width x+1}}{\text{price for width x}} \approx 1.02 $$

. . .

For each additional inch the painting is wider, the price of the painting is expected to be higher, on average, by a factor of 1.02.

## Shortcuts in R

```{r}
m_lprice_wt |>
  tidy() |>
  select(term, estimate) |>
  mutate(estimate = round(estimate, 3))

```{r}
m_lprice_wt |>
  tidy() |>
  select(term, estimate) |>
  mutate(estimate = round(exp(estimate), 3))
```

## Recap: Log Transformations {.smaller}

-   Non-constant variance is one of the most common model violations, however it is usually fixable by transforming the response (y) variable.

. . .

-   The most common transformation when the response variable is right skewed is the log transform: $log(y)$, especially useful when the response variable is (extremely) right skewed.

. . .

-   This transformation is also useful for variance stabilization.

. . .

-   When using a log transformation on the response variable the interpretation of the slope changes: *"For each unit increase in x, y is expected on average to be higher/lower* <br> by a factor of $e^{b_1}$."

. . .

-   Another useful transformation is the square root: $\sqrt{y}$, especially useful when the response variable is counts.

## Aside: when $y = 0$

In some cases the value of the response variable might be 0, and

```{r}
log(0)
```

. . .

The trick is to add a very small number to the value of the response variable for these cases so that the `log` function can still be applied:

```{r}
log(0 + 0.00001)
```

## Recap {.smaller background-color="#92A86A"}

-   Can I carry out linear regression using the `tidymodels` approach?
-   Can I interpret and explain the results from a linear model with a single predictor?
-   Do I understand the limitations of modelling data w/ linear regression?
-   Can I describe and implement the use of a dummy variable in linear regression?
-   Can I determine when logistic transformation may be appropriate? Can I interpret these results?
