# Consider your audience {background-color="#92A86A"}

## What does this mean?

[`r emo::ji("question")` What does it mean to "consider your audience?"]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

. . .

Simply: **You do the work so they don't have to.**

. . .

...also the aesthetic-usability effect exists.

## What's the right level?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**General Audience**\
✔ background\
🚫 limit technical details\
🎉 emphasize take-home\

![](images/08/general.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Technical Audience**\
⬇ limit background\
💻 all-the-details\
🎉 emphasize take-home\

![](images/08/technical.png)

## Considerations

-   **Platform**: written? oral?

. . .

-   **Setting**: informal? formal?

. . .

-   **Timing**: never go over your time limit!

## Storytelling

-   Stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end.

. . .

-   Stories do not need *every* detail of what you've tried

. . .

-   Reports and presentations should tell a story
-   Planning out your report/presentation can help

. . .

-   Hold the audience's attention with what needs to be said; do so effectively
-   Tell your audience why they should care; why it matters
-   You should explain your choices and the "why"

## Choose informative titles

On **presentations**: Balance b/w short and informative (goal: concise)

. . .

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
Avoid: "Analyzing NHANES"
:::

Better: "Data from the NHANES study shows that diet is related to overall health"

. . .

On **visualizations**: emphasize the take-home! (what's learned or what action to take)

. . .

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
Avoid: "Boxplot of gender"
:::

Better: "Twice as many females as males included for analysis"

. . .

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
Avoid: "Tickets vs. Time"
:::

Better: "Staff unable to respond to incoming tickets; need to hire 2 FTEs"

# Effective Oral Communication {background-color="#92A86A"}

Brainstorm: Advice You've Been Given?

## Student responses {.smaller}

Student responses will be added to notes after class...

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
student_responses <- read_sheet('1CRNv9Y9tuFIbxb0mO_XWsL94BUOcQq6LMJC5MHVbEP8')

student_responses |> 
  filter(`Type of Communication` == "Oral") |>
  select(`Advice you've received`) |> 
  kable() |>
    kable_styling() |>
    scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")
```

## Presentations are for listening {.smaller}

-   Advantage: words to explain out loud what you're showing

. . .

-   You are presenting for the person in the back of the room.

. . .

To accomplish:

-   don't read directly off slides

-   repetition is ok: tell what you're going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them

-   use animation to build your story (not to distract)

-   introduce your axes

-   text/labels larger

-   watch your speech speed

-   practice!

## For Example: A Happy Ending for (almost) everyone in Little Red Riding Hood {.smaller}

-   Red Riding Hood (RRH) has to walk 0.54 mi from Point A (home) to Point B (Grandma's)
-   RRH meets Wolf who (1) runs ahead to Grandma's, (2) eats her, and (3) dresses in her clothes
-   RRH arrives at Grandmas at 2PM, asks her three questions
-   Identified problem: after third question, Wolf eats RRH
-   Solution: vendor (Woodsman) employs tool (ax)
-   Expected outcome: Grandma and RRH alive, wolf is not

# ![](images/08/lrr.png){height="80"} Little Red Riding Hood

<!-- Grandma has fallen ill and Red Riding Hood sets out on a walk through the woods with a basket of goodies to deliver to her.  -->

<!-- On her way, she encounters a woodsman and a wolf.  -->

<!-- The wolf runs ahead, eats Grandma, and dresses up in her clothes. -->

<!-- When Red arrives, she senses something is awry. She goes through a series of questions with the wolf, who’s posing as Grandma, -->

<!-- Red says “Oh Grandma, how big your teeth are!”  -->

<!-- The wolf replies “The better to eat you with” and swallows Red whole -->

<!-- The woodsman walks by and, seeing the door to Grandma’s house ajar, decides to investigate.  -->

<!-- He finds the wolf asleep after his meal. -->

<!-- The woodsman suspects what has happened and chops the wolf in half.  -->

<!-- Grandma and Red Riding Hood emerge, safe and sound - a happy ending for all except the wolf -->

# Effective Written Communication {background-color="#92A86A"}

Brainstorm: Advice You've Been Given?

## Student responses {.smaller}

Student responses will be added to notes after class...

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
student_responses |> 
  filter(`Type of Communication` == "Writing") |>
  select(`Advice you've received`) |>

```

## Benefits of written communciation

Your audience has time to process...but the explanation has to be there!

. . .

Visually: more on a single visualization

. . .

Yes, often there are different visualizations for reports/papers than for presentations/lectures.

## When you have time to digest (read)

![](images/08/written.png)

. . .

[`r emo::ji("question")` What makes this an effective visualization for a written communication?"]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

Source: [Storytelling wtih data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/book/downloads) by cole nussbaumer knaflic

## Written Explanations

-   Visualizations should be explained/interpreted
-   Models should be explained
    -   should be clear what question is being answered
    -   what conclusions is being drawn
    -   and what numbers were used to draw that conclusion

## Data Science Reports in .Rmd

-   As concise as possible
-   Necessary details (for your audience); nothing more
    -   Be sure that the knit output contains what you intended (plots displayed; headers etc.)
    -   ...and does NOT display stuff that doesn't need to be there (messages/warnings suppressed, brainstorming, etc.)
-   Typical Sections: Introduction/Background, Setup, Data, Analysis, Conclusion, References

## Controlling HTML document settings

-   Table of Contents

```         
---
title: "Document Title"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
---
```

. . .

-   Theme

```         
---
title: "Document Title"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: united
    highlight: tango
---
```

. . .

-   Figure Options

```         
---
title: "Document Title"
output:
  html_document:
    fig_width: 7
    fig_height: 6
    fig_caption: true
---
```

. . .

-   Code Folding

```         
---
title: "Document Title"
output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide
---
```

## Controlling code chunk output {.smaller}

-   Specified in the curly braces, separated by commas

```{r, chunk-label, results='hide', fig.height=4}

```

. . .

-   `eval`: whether to execute the code chunk
-   `echo`: whether to include the code in the output
-   `warning`, `message`, and `error`: whether to show warnings, messages, or errors in the knit document
-   `fig.width` and `fig.height`: control the width/height of plots

. . .

-   Controlling for the whole document:

``` {eval="FALSE"}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 8, collapse = TRUE)
```

## Editing & Proofreading

-   Did you end up telling a story?
    -   Things missing?
    -   Things to delete?

. . .

-   Do not fall in love with your words/code/plots

. . .

-   Do spell check
-   Do read it over before sending/presenting/submitting

## Aside: Citing Sources {.smaller}

**When are citations needed?**

. . .

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
> "We will be doing our analysis using two different data sets created by two different groups: Donohue and Mustard + Lott, or simply Lott"
:::

. . .

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
> "What turned from the idea of carrying firearms to protect oneself from enemies such as the British monarchy and the unknown frontier of North America has now become a nationwide issue."
:::

. . .

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
> "Right to Carry Laws refer to laws that specify how citizens are allowed to carry concealed handguns when they're away from home without a permit"
:::

. . .

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
> "In this case study, we are examining the relationship between unemployment rate, poverty rate, police staffing, and violent crime rate."
:::

. . .

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
> "In the United States, the second amendment permits the right to bear arms, and this law has not been changed since its creation in 1791."
:::

. . .

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
> "The Right to Carry Laws (RTC) is defined as"a law that specifies if and how citizens are allowed to have a firearm on their person or nearby in public.""
:::

. . .

**Reminder**: You do NOT get docked points for citing others' work. You can be at risk of AI Violation if you don't. **When in doubt, give credit.**

## Footnotes in .Rmd

How to specify a footnote in text:

``` {eval="FALSE"}
Here is some body text.[^1]
```

How to include the footnote's reference:

``` {eval="FALSE"}
[^1]: This footnote will appear at the bottom of the page.
```

## Additional Guidance

-   White space is like garlic - take the amount you need and triple it
-   Fonts Matter
-   Use Color Effectively
