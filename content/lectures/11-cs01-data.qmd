# CS01: Biomarkers of Recent Use (Data) {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Q&A {.smaller}

>Q: How much time are we expected to spend on the case studies? \
>A: That's hard to say. I would recommend spending a bit of time after each lecture ensuring I understand the code presented. It will eventually be included in your final report, so you'll need to understand/describe/explain it. After the case study has been presented, I would expect a few hours from each group member to complete the extension and write the report. Last year students reported typically spending 4-6h on case studies (with a big range around that median).

>Q: For the general project plan how much time should we budget towards working on this?\
>A: Students report spending ~10h on their final project

>Q: Are we allowed to work with some of our case study partners for a final project? \
>A: Absolutely! My hope is through the case studies students will get to know one another a bit and hopefully want to work together again!

# Background {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVAs)
- 2/3 of US trauma center admissions are due to MVAs 
- ~60% of such patients testing positive for drugs or alcohol 
- Alcohol and cannabis are most frequently detected

Source: [https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/59/3/478/5621997]()

## Legalization of Marijuana

- Federally illegal in the US
- Decriminalized in many states 
- Medically available in 15 states
- Legal for recreational use in 24 states (including CA)

## Increased roadside surveys

::: incremental
- 25% increase in use nationwide from 2002 to 2015 ([survey](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1913))
- THC detection in drivers increased by 48% from 2007 to 2014
- Increased prevalence of consumption -> possible intoxication -> possible impaired driving -> public health concern
:::

## DUI of Alcohol (DUIA)

::: incremental
- The science is there. Don't do it.
- DUIA has decreased since the 1970s 
  - % of nighttime, weekend drivers testing over the legal limit (BAC > 0.08 g/dL) decreased from 7.5% (1973) to 2.2% (2007) [link]((https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1913))
:::

## DUI of Cannabis

- In a 2007 survey, 16.3% of nighttime drivers were drug-positive [link](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1913)
  - 8.6% of these tested positive for THC
- Experimental and cognitive studies suggest cannabis-induced impairment increases risk of motor vehicle crashes:

. . .

> Evidence suggests recent smoking and/or blood THC concentrations 2–5 ng/mL are associated with substantial driving impairment, particularly in occasional smokers.[link](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/59/3/478/5621997)


## Roadside Detection

- *per se* laws: "a driver is deemed to have committed an offense if THC is detected at or above a pre-determined cutoff" [link](https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2020.1851685)

. . .

- Defining cutoffs for safe driving is difficult
- THC concentration differs by:
  - "smoking topography" (time to smoke; number of puffs)
  - frequency of use
  - route of ingestion
  
. . .

As of 2021...[link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2020.1851685)

:::incremental
- 19 states have *per se* or zero tolerance cannabis laws
- States with *per se* laws (Illinois, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and West Virginia), cutoffs range from 1 to 5 ng/mL THC in whole blood.
- In 3 states, *per se* limits also apply to THC metabolites
- Colorado: "reasonable inference" - blood
contained >5 ng/mL THC at the time of the offense
- 3 states zero tolerance for THC; 8 states for THC and metabolites
:::



## Metabolism

:::incremental
- peak blood concentrations occur during smoking, then drop rapidly [link](https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/36/6/405/791790)
- subjective 'high' persists for several hours, varies greatly between individuals
- THC concentrations remain detectable in frequent users longer than occasional users [link](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/59/3/519/5622035)
- THC and certain metabolites can be detected in blood for weeks to months after use and do not necessarily indicate impairment
:::

## Detection

Various approaches: 

1. Detect impairment (officers detect DUIC)
2. Detect recent use (test for compounds)
3. Combine recent use + impairment

. . .

Focus here: Can we identify a biomarker of recent use? 

- recent use: defined here as within 3h
- testing THC and metabolites in blood, oral fluid (OF), and breath

## Aside: Case Study Report

- Your Case study will need a background section
- It can use/summarize/paraphrase the information here (you should cite the source, not me)
- But, you're *not* limited to this information
- You are allowed/encouraged to dig deeper, include what's most important, add to, remove, etc.
- There are a lot of citations in this section - go ahead and peruse them/others/use references in these papers

# Question {background-color="#92A86A"}

Which compound, in which matrix, and at what cutoff is the best biomarker of recent use?

# The Data {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Participants

- placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized study

. . .

- recruited:
  - volunteers 21-55y/o
  - had a driver's license
  - self-reported cannabis use >= 4x in the past month

. . .

- Participants were:
  - compensated
  - medically evaluated (for safety)
  - asked to refrain from use for 2d prior to participation
  - exclusion criteria: OF THC concentration ≥5 ng/mL on day of study (n=7)
  
. . .

- Study included 191 participants

## Experimental Design

Participants were:

:::incremental
- randomly assigned to receive a cigarette containing placebo (0.02%), or 5.9% or 13.4% THC
- Blood, OF and breath were collected prior to smoking
- smoked a 700 mg cigarette *ad libitum* within 10 min, with a minimum of four puffs.
- After smoking, 4 additional OF and breath and 8 blood collections were completed at time points up to ∼6h from the start of smoking. 
- Participants ate and drank water between collections, although not within 10 min of OF collection.

## Question

[`r emo::ji("question")` We're doing very similar things across three similar (albeit different) datasets. What would be a better approach?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}


## Storing compounds

We'll need these later in our functions
```{r}
# whole blood
compounds_WB <-  as.list(colnames(Filter(function(x) !all(is.na(x)), WB[6:13])))

# breath
compounds_BR <-  as.list(colnames(Filter(function(x) !all(is.na(x)), BR[6])))

# oral fluid
compounds_OF <-  as.list(colnames(Filter(function(x) !all(is.na(x)), OF[6:12])))
```

. . .

```{r}
# to get a sense of output
compounds_WB
```

## Storing timepoints

```{r timepoints}
timepoints_WB = tibble(start = c(-400, 0, 30, 70, 100, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300), 
                       stop = c(0, 30, 70, 100, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, max(WB$time_from_start, na.rm = TRUE)), 
                       timepoint = c("pre-smoking","0-30 min","31-70 min",
                                     "71-100 min","101-180 min","181-210 min",
                                     "211-240 min","241-270 min",
                                     "271-300 min", "301+ min") )
```

. . .

```{r}
timepoints_WB
```

. . .

...and in BR and OF 

```{r}
timepoints_BR = tibble(start = c(-400, 0, 40, 90, 180, 210, 240, 270), 
                       stop = c(0, 40, 90, 180, 210, 240, 270, 
                                max(BR$time_from_start, na.rm = TRUE)), 
                       timepoint = c("pre-smoking","0-40 min","41-90 min",
                                     "91-180 min", "181-210 min", "211-240 min",
                                     "241-270 min", "271+ min"))
timepoints_OF = tibble(start = c(-400, 0, 30, 90, 180, 210, 240, 270), 
                       stop = c(0, 30, 90, 180, 210, 240, 270, 
                                max(OF$time_from_start, na.rm = TRUE)), 
                       timepoint = c("pre-smoking","0-30 min","31-90 min",
                                     "91-180 min", "181-210 min", "211-240 min",
                                     "241-270 min", "271+ min") )
```

## First UDF: `assign_timepoint`

```{r}
assign_timepoint <- function(x, timepoints){
  if(!is.na(x)){ 
    timepoints$timepoint[x > timepoints$start & x <= timepoints$stop]
  }else{
    NA
  }
}
```

[`r emo::ji("brain")` What's a UDF? What do you think this is doing?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}


## Timepoints to use

```{r}
 WB <- WB |> 
  mutate(timepoint_use = map_chr(time_from_start, 
                                 assign_timepoint, 
                                 timepoints=timepoints_WB),
         timepoint_use = fct_relevel(timepoint_use, timepoints_WB$timepoint))

# let's get a sense for what this did
levels(WB$timepoint_use)
```

Note: `map_*` allow you to apply a function across multiple "things" (here: across all rows in a dataframe)

[`r emo::ji("question")`What do you think the above is doing?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}


. . .


```{r}
OF <- OF |> 
  mutate(timepoint_use = map_chr(time_from_start, 
                                 assign_timepoint, 
                                 timepoints=timepoints_OF),
         timepoint_use = fct_relevel(timepoint_use, timepoints_OF$timepoint))

BR <- BR |> 
  mutate(timepoint_use = map_chr(time_from_start, 
                                 assign_timepoint, 
                                 timepoints=timepoints_BR),
         timepoint_use = fct_relevel(timepoint_use, timepoints_BR$timepoint))
```

## Drop Duplicates

```{r}
 drop_dups <- function(dataset){
  out <- dataset |> 
    filter(!is.na(timepoint_use)) |> 
    group_by(timepoint_use) |> 
    distinct(id, .keep_all = TRUE) |> 
    ungroup()
  return(out)
} 
```

[`r emo::ji("question")`What do you think the above is doing?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

. . .

```{r}
WB_dups <- drop_dups(WB)
OF_dups <- drop_dups(OF)
BR_dups <- drop_dups(BR)
```

[`r emo::ji("question")`What would you do to try to understand what this has done?]{style="background-color: #ADD8E6"}

## Saving Intermediate Files

Cleaned/wrangled files as CSVs:

```{r}
write_csv(WB, "data/WB_clean.csv")
write_csv(BR, "data/BR_clean.csv")
write_csv(OF, "data/OF_clean.csv")
```

Note: can lose "type" of object (factor levels)

. . .

(Alt) Save as RData:

```{r}
save(compounds_WB, compounds_BR, compounds_OF, file="data/compounds.RData")
save(timepoints_WB, timepoints_BR, timepoints_OF, file="data/timepoints.RData")
save(WB, BR, OF, WB_dups, BR_dups, OF_dups, file="data/data_clean.RData")


```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
save(compounds_WB, compounds_BR, compounds_OF, file="content/lectures/data/compounds.RData")
save(timepoints_WB, timepoints_BR, timepoints_OF, file="content/lectures/data/timepoints.RData")
save(WB, BR, OF, WB_dups, BR_dups, OF_dups, file="content/lectures/data/data_clean.RData")

```
