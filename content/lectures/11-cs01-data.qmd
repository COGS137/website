# Background {background-color="#92A86A"}

## Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVAs)
- 2/3 of US trauma center admissions are due to MVAs 
- ~60% of such patients testing positive for drugs or alcohol 
- Alcohol and cannabis are most frequently detected

## Legalization of Marijuana

- Federally illegal in the US
- Decriminalized in many states
- Medically available in
- Legal for recreational use in ...

## Increased roadside surveys

::: incremental
- 25% increase in use nationwide from 2002 to 2015 (survey)
- THC detection in drivers increased by 48% from 2007 to 2014
- Increased prevalence of consumption -> possible intoxication -> possible impaired driving -> public health concern
:::

## DUI of Alcohol (DUIA)

::: incremental
- The science is there. Don't do it.
- DUIA has decreased since the 1970s 
  - % of nighttime, weekend drivers testing over the legal limit (BAC > 0.08 g/dL) decreased from 7.5% (1973) to 2.2% (2007)
:::

## DUI of Cannabis

- In a 2007 survey[^1], 16.3% of nighttime drivers were drug-positive
  - 8.6% of these tested positive for THC
- Experimental and cognitive studies suggest cannabis-induced impairment increases risk of motor vehicle crashes:

. . .

> Evidence suggests recent smoking and/or blood THC concentrations 2â€“5 ng/mL are associated with substantial driving impairment, particularly in occasional smokers.[^1]
