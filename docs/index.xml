      <description>DRAFT: This will be updated and finalized by week 1 of the Fall 2021 quarter.
Class: Class will include short lectures as well as interactive activities. The goal of lecture is to introduce the topics and information needed for the course. The goal of your time outside of lecture is to practice with topics that are introduced and deepen your understanding of material presented in class. Since so much of programming and statistical analysis is learned best by doing, we&#39;ll prioritize that throughout the course, both in and outside of the classroom.</description>
