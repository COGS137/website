## Lab 05: Exploring Case Study 1

- Using same data we've been discussing in class
- Provided in an already-wrangled format
- For your hw03 and case study report, you will have to do the wrangling
- but in this lab, the goal is to get started working with the data

## Reminder that this is based off of...

"Beauty in the classroom: instructorsâ€™ pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity"

## Some new challenges in this lab
- Little guidance for Part 1 - it's up to you to determine what visualizations help you explore and learn about the data; feel free to discuss with classmates!
- There are some unwieldy functions you'll be looking at and explaining in Part 2 - it's the first time you've done something like this. Take the code line-by-line if you're struggling to digest it all at once
- Brainstorming in Part 3 is meant to be *very* open. There are no "wrong" ideas or "bad" suggestions. If you've got a thought, include it there. For your final report and in your discussions with your group, you can narrow your ideas down. Better to start with too many ideas than not enough!
