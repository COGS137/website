## Some notes on this lab
- This is an extension of lab04. It may be worth briefly looking over that lab and/or the answer key to get that fresh in your mind prior to beginning this lab.
- There are three parts. We'll be grading to see that *at least one model with more than one predictor* has been *fit and interpreted*.
