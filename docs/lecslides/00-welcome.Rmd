Practical Data Science in R

## What is R?

<i class="fa fa-code fa"></i> : R is a statistical programming language. 


While R has most/all of the functionality of **YFPL** (your favorite programming language), it was designed for the specific use of analyzing data.

Nope! The first few weeks of the course will be all about getting **comfortable using the R programming language**!

After that, we'll focus on delving into interesting statistical analyses through **case studies**.

## Create your first data visualization

- Once you log on to RStudio Cloud, click on this course's workspace "COGS 137 - FA21"
- You should see a project called UN Votes, fork it by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-fork"></i> icon. This will create your copy of the project and launch it.
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `unvotes.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Then change the country names to those you're interested in. Your spelling and capitalization should match the data so take a peek at the Appendix to see how the country names are spelled. Knit again. And voila, your first data visualization!
