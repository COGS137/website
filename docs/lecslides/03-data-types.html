## Q&amp;A

.small[
Q: Am I supposed to understand what we did in class today for installing SSH keys? I was honestly just following directions but not understanding anything.  
A: While at most points in this course I would say "understanding is really important," this is the one case where really just following instructions was what we were going for. You will NOT be tested/evaluated on the process of generating SSH keys in this course nor will you be tested on what they are. However, for knowledge's sake: the process we used in class is largely spelled out [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) (for future reference). And, a brief description of what SSH keys are can be found [here](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html).

Q: How to submit the lab and HW? 
A: Labs, you'll just push your changes to github from RStudio. And, you'll be done. Homeworks, there will be one more step, but we'll discuss that next week.

Q: Is lab going to be done together in person on Friday?!  
A: Yup! There will be a description of the lab and a demo, along with time to work on the lab today in lab. You're always free to look at it ahead of time, but it's not required.

Q: What's the difference between the SSH and HTTPS?  
A: This is not something you will be tested on, but there is a bit of an explanation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories). Briefly, each process is a way to "communicate" with a "remote" repository on GitHub with both processes accomplshing this goal. This is a way for your computer (or datahub) to "talk to" your files on GitHub. If you're using the HTTPS process, you have to type in your username and personal access token (which is longer and more complex than your password) everytime you want to "talk" to GitHub. To avoid this, we're using SSH this quarter. This is what we did in class, where you generated an SSH key-pair and told GitHub about that key-pair.

class: center, middle

# Data"sets"

---

## Data "sets" in R

- "set" is in quotation marks because it is not a formal data class

- A tidy data "set" can be one of the following types:
    + `tibble`
    + `data.frame`

- We'll often work with `tibble`s:
    + `readr` package (e.g. `read_csv` function) loads data as a `tibble` by default
    + `tibble`s are part of the tidyverse, so they work well with other packages we are using
    + they make minimal assumptions about your data, so are less likely to cause hard to track bugs in your code

---

## Data frames

.midi[
- A data frame is the most commonly used data structure in R, they are list of equal length vectors (usually atomic, but can be generic). Each vector is treated as a column and elements of the vectors as rows.

- A tibble is a type of data frame that ... makes your life (i.e. data analysis) easier.

- Most often a data frame will be constructed by reading in from a file, but we can create them from scratch.


```r
df &lt;- tibble(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
class(df)
```

```
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
```

```r
glimpse(df)
```

```
## Rows: 3
## Columns: 2
## $ x &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3
## $ y &lt;chr&gt; "a", "b", "c"
```
]
---

## Data frames (cont.)


```r
attributes(df)
```

```
## $class
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
## 
## $row.names
## [1] 1 2 3
## 
## $names
## [1] "x" "y"
```

--

Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:


```r
dataframe$var_name
```

---
## Data frames (cont.)


```r
class(df$x)  # access variable type for column
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
class(df$y)  
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

---

### Variable Types

Data stored in columns can include different *kinds* of information...which would require a different *type* (`class`) of variable to be used in R.

.pull-left[

.pull-right[

R Data Types:
  + .ocean[Continuous]: numeric, integer
  + .ocean[Discrete]: factors (we haven't talked about these yet, but will today!)

---

### Variable Types (cont.)

Sometimes data are non-numeric and store words. Even when that is the case, the data can be conveying different information.

## Example: Cat lovers

A survey asked respondents their name and number of cats. The instructions said to enter the number of cats as a numerical value.

## The Question

.question[
How many respondents have a below average number of cats?
]

--

### Giving it a first shot...


```r
cat_lovers |&gt;
  summarise(mean = mean(number_of_cats))
```

```
## Warning in mean.default(number_of_cats): argument is not numeric or logical:
## returning NA
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##    mean
##   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1    NA
```

--

.question[
💡 maybe there is missing data in the `number_of_cats` column!
]

---

## Oh why will you *still* not work??!!


```r
cat_lovers |&gt;
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```
## Warning in mean.default(number_of_cats, na.rm = TRUE): argument is not numeric
## or logical: returning NA
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   mean_cats
##       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1        NA
```

--

.question[
💡What is the **type** of the `number_of_cats` variable?
]

---

## Take a breath and look at your data

--


```r
glimpse(cat_lovers)
```

```
## Rows: 60
## Columns: 3
## $ name           &lt;chr&gt; "Bernice Warren", "Woodrow Stone", "Willie Bass", "Tyro…
## $ number_of_cats &lt;chr&gt; "0", "0", "1", "3", "3", "2", "1", "1", "0", "0", "0", …
## $ handedness     &lt;chr&gt; "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left",…
```

## Sometimes you need to babysit your respondents


```r
cat_lovers |&gt;
  mutate(number_of_cats = case_when(
    name == "Ginger Clark" ~ 2,
    name == "Doug Bass"    ~ 3,
    TRUE                   ~ as.numeric(number_of_cats)
  )) |&gt;
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```

```
## Warning in eval_tidy(pair$rhs, env = default_env): NAs introduced by coercion
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   mean_cats
##       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0.817
```

---

## Always respect (&amp; check!) data types


```r
cat_lovers |&gt;
  mutate(
    number_of_cats = case_when(
      name == "Ginger Clark" ~ "2",
      name == "Doug Bass"    ~ "3",
      TRUE                   ~ number_of_cats
    ),
    number_of_cats = as.numeric(number_of_cats)
  ) |&gt;
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   mean_cats
##       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0.817
```

---

## Now that we know what we're doing...


```r
cat_lovers &lt;- cat_lovers |&gt;
  mutate(
    number_of_cats = case_when(
      name == "Ginger Clark" ~ "2",
      name == "Doug Bass"    ~ "3",
      TRUE                   ~ number_of_cats
    ),
    number_of_cats = as.numeric(number_of_cats)
  )
```

---

## Moral of the story

- If your data does not behave how you expect it to, type coercion upon reading in the data might be the reason.

- Go in and investigate your data, apply the fix, *save your data*, live happily ever after.

---

## Working with tibbles in pipelines


```r
mean_cats &lt;- cat_lovers |&gt;
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))

cat_lovers |&gt;
  filter(number_of_cats &lt; mean_cats) |&gt;
  nrow()
```

```
## [1] 60
```

--

.question[
❓ Do you believe this number? Why, why not?
]

---

## A result of a pipeline is always a tibble


```r
mean_cats
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   mean_cats
##       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0.817
```

```r
class(mean_cats)
```

```
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
```

---

### `pull()` can be your new best friend

...but use it sparingly!

.small[

```r
mean_cats &lt;- cat_lovers |&gt;
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats)) |&gt;
  pull()

cat_lovers |&gt;
  filter(number_of_cats &lt; mean_cats) |&gt;
  nrow()
```

```
## [1] 33
```
]
--


```r
mean_cats
```

```
## [1] 0.8166667
```

```r
class(mean_cats)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

---

class: center, middle

# Factors

---

## Factors

Factor objects are how R stores data for categorical variables (fixed numbers of discrete values).


```r
(x = factor(c("BS", "MS", "PhD", "MS")))
```

```
## [1] BS  MS  PhD MS 
## Levels: BS MS PhD
```


```r
glimpse(x)
```

```
##  Factor w/ 3 levels "BS","MS","PhD": 1 2 3 2
```


```r
typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

---

## Read data in as character strings


```r
glimpse(cat_lovers)
```

```
## Rows: 60
## Columns: 3
## $ name           &lt;chr&gt; "Bernice Warren", "Woodrow Stone", "Willie Bass", "Tyro…
## $ number_of_cats &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0…
## $ handedness     &lt;chr&gt; "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left",…
```

---

## But coerce when plotting


```r
ggplot(cat_lovers, mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

![](03-data-types_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Use forcats to manipulate factors


```r
cat_lovers &lt;- cat_lovers |&gt;
  mutate(handedness = fct_relevel(handedness, 
                                  "right", "left", "ambidextrous"))
```


```r
ggplot(cat_lovers, mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

![](03-data-types_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

## Come for the functionality

.pull-left[
... stay for the hex

.pull-right[
.small[
![](img/03/hex-forcats.png)
]]

- R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. Historically, factors were much easier to work with than character vectors, so many base R functions automatically convert character vectors to factors.

- factors are still useful when you have true categorical data, and when you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display. The goal of the forcats package is to provide a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors.

## Recap
- Always best to think of data as part of a tibble
    + This plays nicely with the `tidyverse` as well
    + Rows are observations, columns are variables
- Be careful about data types / classes
    + Sometimes `R` makes silly assumptions about your data class 
        + Using `tibble`s help, but it might not solve all issues
        + Think about your data in context, e.g. 0/1 variable is most likely a `factor`
    + If a plot/output is not behaving the way you expect, first
    investigate the data class
    + If you are absolutely sure of a data class, over-write it in your
    tibble so that you don't need to keep having to keep track of it
        + `mutate` the variable with the correct class
