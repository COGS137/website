## Q&amp;A

.small[
Q: I noticed on slide 32 (28/49) the code said "bike &lt;- bike |&gt; mutate(do stuff)". This code overwrites the default bike dataset, but mutate doesn't change any existing data. If we had performed operations which do change the existing data (i.e., transmute) should we simply just assign it to another variable not named 'bike' if I still want to use the default data in 'bike'?  
A: Yup! 

Q: I am still a bit uncertain about how group_by() works. If a tibble were divided into 3 groups, does the function create 3 new tibbles or just one new tibble that has 3 sections?  
A: It does not create three new tibbles. It operates within the same tibble but operates on the 3 groups.

## Aesthetics options

Commonly used characteristics of plotting characters that can be **mapped to a specific variable** in the data are

- `color`
- `shape`
- `size`
- `alpha` (transparency)

## Mapping vs. setting

- **Mapping:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points based on the values of a variable in the data
  - goes into `aes()`

- **Setting:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points **not** based on the values of a variable in the data
  - goes into `geom_*()` (this was `geom_point()` in the previous example, but we'll learn about other geoms soon!)

# Faceting

## Faceting

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data
- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data

## Various ways to facet

.question[
In the next few slides describe what each plot displays. Think about how the code relates to the output.

**Note:** The plots in the next few slides do not have proper titles, axis labels, etc. because we want you to figure out what's happening in the plots.
But you should always label your plots!

## Faceting summary

- `facet_grid()`:
    - 2d grid
    - `rows ~ cols`
    - use `.` for no split
- `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped according to number of rows and columns specified or available plotting area
