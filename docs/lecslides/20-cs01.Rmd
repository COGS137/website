## Q&A

Q:

## Course Announcements  

- **lab08** due Friday (logistic regression)
- **cs02** due  Monday

--

Grades posted:

- **lab07** scores posted
  - -0.1 | did not knit
  - -0.1+ | did not look to us like an hour's worth of work; reference answer key; follow up if you're unsure
- **cs01** grades and feedback posted (discussing today) 

---

## The Rest of the Quarter:

Due Dates: 
- lab08 - due Friday 11/19 (wk8)
- CS02 - due Monday 11/22 (wk9)

--

- CS03 - due Friday 12/3 (wk10)
- Final Project - due Mon 12/6 (Finals Week)
  - details will be discussed this coming Monday

--

Going forward:
- Focus is really on the case studies
- No lab09 to turn in or hw05 (full credit will be awarded)
- lab will happen during week 10, but it will be for case study and project questions/progress

---

## Case Study 01 Feedback: General

- Pretty happy overall
- We're looking for steady improvement with each Case Study
- Look at your HTMLs after you generate them
- Consider Rmd tips/tricks discussed last class

---

## Case Study 01 Feedback: Background & Question 

- Pretty good generally
- Be sure to cite sources...and be sure they reference is correct
- Should be clear which statements came from which sources
- Questions being asked should be clearly stated

---

## Feedback: Data & Wrangling 

- A general introduction to the data being used is a good idea
- Did a good job on wrangling/explaining steps (after hw feedback)
- For CS02, we'll be reading explanations and code comments carefully to be sure you understood the ocde


---

## Feedback: EDA

- OK job here
- Note that not every plot you make has to be included. 
- The plots included in your report should help you understand your dataset 
- Each plot should be interpreted. This is not just an explanation of what is plotted...but an explanation in the context of the data/question being asked
- Work together to critique and improve plots. Ask yourself "What is the "take-home" message of this plot? And, can I improve how clearly this plot makes that message?"

---

## Feedback: Analysis

- A lot of variability here.
- Whenever you run a statistical test, add a regression line, etc. it should be clear to you (and the reader!) what question you're answering
- Your analysis should tell a story that, at the end answers your questions of interest
- Analyses *must* be quantified, interpreted, and contextualized

---

## Feedback: Conclusion/Discussion

- Pretty good job here.
- These do not have to be particularly long
- Discussing limitations and future directions a good idea

---

## Feedback: Extension

- The simplest/most-straightforward extension is adding a question/questions to the analysis. If you do this, it will be clear what your extension is
- If you've chosen some other extension, please state this clearly in your report. Something like "We've extended beyond the initial case study by..."
- For CS01, we were *pretty* lenient on what counted for two reasons: 1) first go at this; 2) there wasn't a *ton* of different directions to go in given the data that were provided
- For CS02, there's *a lot* that can be done, so we'll be looking for a bit more

## Reminder: These Case Studies are from OCS

You can learn from and take inspiration from the case study directly.
