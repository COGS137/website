	            <p>DRAFT: This will be updated and finalized by week 1 of the Fall 2021 quarter.</p>

<h3 id="class">Class:</h3>

<p>Class will include short lectures as well as interactive activities. The goal of lecture is to introduce the topics and information needed for the course. The goal of your time outside of lecture is to practice with topics that are introduced and deepen your understanding of material presented in class. Since so much of programming and statistical analysis is learned best by doing, we'll prioritize that throughout the course, both in and outside of the classroom.</p>

<h3 id="diversity--inclusiveness">Diversity &amp; Inclusiveness:</h3>

<p>My goal is that every student, regardless of their background or perspective, will be well-served by this course. My philosophy is that the diversity of students in this class is a huge asset to our learning community; our differences provide opportunities for learning and understanding. I intend to present course materials that are conscious of and respectful to diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, politics, and culture); however, if I ever fall short or if you ever have suggestions for improvement, please do share with me! This feedback is always welcomed, and I am always in the process of learning and improving to this end.</p>

<h4 id="what-should-you-call-me">What should you call me?</h4>

<p>Most students call me Professor/Prof Ellis, and that's great! This is how I typically sign emails to students. I'm also totally OK with you addressing me as Shannon or Dr. Ellis.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-should-call-you">What I should call you</h4>

<p>I should call you by your preferred name, with the correct pronunciation. Please correct me (in the moment or via email/Caampsuwire after the fact...however you're most comfortable) if I ever make a mistake.</p>

<h3 id="disability-access">Disability Access</h3>

<p>Students requesting accommodations due to a disability should provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. If you are struggling to get necessary accommodations or want to further discuss your accommodations, please feelf ree to reach out to Professor Ellis</p>

<p>Contacting the OSD can help you further:<br>
858.534.4382 (phone)<br>
osd@ucsd.edu (email)<br>
<a href="http://disabilities.ucsd.edu">http://disabilities.ucsd.edu</a></p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-help">How to get help:</h3>

<p>It's great that we have so many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we're able to get to everyone's questions.</p>

<p>That said, to ensure that we're respecting their time, TAs and IAs have been instructed they're only obligated to answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9AM-5PM). Professor Ellis is also going to do her best to stick to these working hours and only go on Campuswire MWF each week. However, I know that's not necessarily when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to post whenever is best for you while knowing that if you post late at night or on a weekend, you may not get a response until the next weekday. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question.</p>

<p>If you have:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>questions about course content</strong> - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so post these to Campuswire!</li>
<li><strong>a technical assignment question</strong> - come to office hours (or post to Campuswire). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished 'in person' where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. However, if that is not possible, post your question to Campuswire. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask. And, for those answering, help your classmates as much as you can without just giving the answer. Help guide them, point them in a direction, provide pseudo code, but do not provide code that answers assignment questions.</li>
<li><strong>been stuck on something for a while (&gt;30min) and aren't even really sure where to start</strong> - Programming can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn't working. That's OK - we've all been there! IF you are stuck, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren't exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30 minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, post on Campuswire). If you don't have a specific question, include the information you have (what you're stuck on, the code you've been trying that hasn't been happening, and/or the error messages you've been getting).</li>
<li><strong>questions about course logistics</strong> - first, check the syllabus. If you can't find the answer there, first ask a classmate. If still unsure, post on Campuswire.</li>
<li><strong>questions about a grade</strong> - Post on Campuswire with &quot;regrades&quot; tag in a private post to &quot;Instructors &amp; TAs&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>something super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth</strong> - feel free to email Professor Ellis (sellis@ucsd.edu) or come to office hours. Be sure to include COGS18 in the email subject line and your full name in your message.</li>
<li><strong>some feedback about the course you want to share anonymously</strong> - If you've been offended by an example in class, really liked or disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn't but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/2nXnDNbgYuS1OsGF2">anonymous Google Form</a>*</li>
</ul>

<p>*This form can be taken down at any time if it's not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity:</h3>

<p>Don't cheat.</p>

<p>You are generally encouraged to work together and help one another in this course. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. A helpful heuristic can b to ask yourself &quot;Can I explain each piece of code and each analysis carried out in what I'm submitting? Could I reproduce this code/analysis on my own?&quot;; you should be able to answer &quot;Yes&quot;&quot; to both questions for everything you submit in this course. For labs and assignments, you are allowed and encouraged to work together, but it is your responsibility to ensure you understand everything you've submitted. (For exams, all work has to be completed individually and communication with others about the exam is not allowed; this will be discussed more explicitly before exams.)</p>

<p><strong>A note on sharing / reusing code:</strong> The Internet is an excellent resource; there will be many times you find helpful information online. You <em>shoould</em> use available resources (e.g. StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite any code you use directly or any code you use as inspiration. This can be done by including the URL/reference to the source directly in your code (as a code comment) or in accompanying text for a given assignment/exam/lab. You should never share code directly (e.g. copy + paste; share an send an answer to a classmate), but you can discuss code and work together on everything other than take-home exams.</p>

<p>Please review UCSD's academic integrity policies <a href="http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu">here</a>.</p>

<p>Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, Canvas or DataHub is down or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact Professor Ellis by emailing your assignment (sellis@ucsd.edu), or else it will be graded as late.</p>

<h3 id="course-components">Course components:</h3>

<h4 id="readings--reading-quizzes-8">Readings &amp; Reading Quizzes (8%):</h4>

<p>Readings will be assigned for some class days and are to be completed prior to the day's lecture. These are meant to provide background and additional context for the upcoming day's lecture topics. Reading quizzes will be used to help keep you on top of the reading material. Each day with assigned readings will have a short accompanying reading quiz on Canvas. These will be of varied question type (multiple choice, short answer, T/F, etc.)</p>

<h4 id="lecture">Lecture:</h4>

<p>Lectures will be your introduction to course topics and material. Lectures will be interactive, and you will be given time to practice with the lecture concepts during class. Attendance is not required, but is strongly encouraged and incentivized. Students who attend 80% of class lectures will have their lowest homework grade replaced with full credit.</p>

<p>In case you miss class or would like to review the material covered in class, you can view the podcasts <a href="https://podcast.ucsd.edu">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="labs-18">Labs (18%):</h4>

<p>Labs are meant to give you hands-on experience with the technical and statistical topics introduced during lecture in a low-stakes environment. Lab sections will comprise of a short review and explanation of the lab and then time for you to complete the assigned weekly lab. Labs are submitted individually, but you are encouraged to work together during lab. You are free to ask an answer each other's questions and discuss your work. Instructional staff will be present during lab to help further your understanding.</p>

<p>Labs are graded for concerted effort. This is because when we learn something new, mistakes are going to happen! In fact, we learn <em>a lot</em> from the mistakes we make during the learning process. If your submission reflects ~50 min of work/effort, you will receive full credit for the week's lab.</p>

<p>Lab attendance is not required, but is strongly encouraged and incentivized. Students who attend 7 (out of the possible 9) labs will receive full credit for the lab portion of their grade (regardless of their weekly lab scores).</p>

<p>Labs are due on Fridays by 11:59 PM.</p>

<h4 id="homework-275">Homework (27.5%):</h4>

<p>After practice in lecture and labs, homework assignments are meant to demonstrate your solidified understanding of the course material. These are typically 2-4x longer and more involved than labs. Homework assignments are completed and submitted individually and are marked for correctness. You <em>are</em> allowed to work together on homework assignments, but academic integrity must be upheld.</p>

<p>On weeks with homework assigned, these are due on Mondays at 11:59 PM.</p>

<h4 id="midterm-125">Midterm (12.5%):</h4>

<p>There will be a single take-home exam due in week 4, and you will have at least 72 hours to complete it. This exam is meant to assess your understanding of the R programming language prior to us moving into focusing on case studies and full analysis. The exam will be completed individually and will be open-notes and open-Internet; however, you will <em>not</em> be permitted to ask questions of one another, the Internet, nor instructional staff while completing the take-home exam.</p>

<p>Your exam will be due Monday Oct 18th at 11:59 PM.</p>

<h4 id="teams">Teams:</h4>

<p>Teams of 3-4 students will need be formed by the end of week 5. All four projects throughout the quarter will be completed with the same teammates. (Your teammates will also be a great resource during labs and assignments.)</p>

<h4 id="case-study-projects-21">Case Study Projects (21%):</h4>

<p>Starting week 5, we will transition to a project-based course. This will allow us to use case studies to focus on deepening statistical knowledge and carrying out interesting analyses. In this, specific case studies and statistics topics will be discussed in class. In your teams and for each of the three case studies, you will 1) extend the analysis from class and 2) write up a full report of the case study for your team project.</p>

<p>On weeks with case study projects assigned, these are due on Mondays at 11:59 PM.</p>

<h4 id="final-project-13">Final Project (13%):</h4>

<p>The final project will be completed with your team, and will be very open ended. More details will be provided in class, but the idea is that you will tackle a problem/question using the tools and techniques discussed in class.</p>

<p>Final Projects will be due on the date of the final exam at 11:59 PM. (You do not need to show up anywhere on the day/time of the assigned final exam.)</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading:</h3>

<p>Your final grade will be comprised of the following:</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped text-left">
<thead>
<tr>
<th><span></span></th>
<th><span></span></th>

</tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="late--missed-work">Late / missed work</h3>

<p>Late homework assignments and case study projects will be accepted up to 3 days (72 hours) after the assigned deadline. Late submissions will receive a 25% deduction.</p>

<p>There are no late deadlines for labs, the exam, or the final project.</p>

<p>Note: Prof Ellis is a reasonable person; reach out to her if you have an extenuating circumstance at any point in the quarter.</p>

<h3 id="regrade-requests">Regrade requests</h3>

<p>We will work hard to grade everyone fairly and return assignments quickly. And, we know you also work hard and want you to receive the grade you've earned. Occasionally, grading mistakes do happen, and it's important to us to correct them. If you think there is a mistake in your grade on an assignment, post <em>privately</em> on Campuswire to &quot;Instructors&quot; using the &quot;regrades&quot; tag within 72 hours. This post should include evidence of why you think your answer was correct and should point to the specific part of the assignment in question.</p>

<h3 id="professionalism">Professionalism</h3>

<p>Please refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class. Not only is this distracting to you, but it can also be distracting to those around you. (Note that there is no consequence associated with this. I know it can be difficult, but I ask that you try your best!)</p>
