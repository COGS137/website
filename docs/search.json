    "text": "Course Info\nPractical Data Science in R focuses on teaching students how to think rigorously throughout the data science process. To this end, through interaction with unique data sets and interesting questions, this course helps students 1) gain fluency in the R programming language, 2) effectively explore & visualize data, 3) use statistical thinking to analyze data and rigorously evaluate their conclusions, and 4) effectively communicate their results. Course objectives are accomplished through hands-on practice, using real-world data to learn via case studies, and project-based learning.\n\nDays & Times\n\n\n\n\n\n Lecture: Tu/Th 2-3:20 (Peterson Hall 104)\n Lab: Fri 1-1:50 (Peterson Hall 104)\n\nInstructional Staff & Office Hours\n\n\n\nInstructor\nShannon Ellis\nsellis@ucsd.edu\nWed 2-3\nVirtual (see canvas)\n\n\n\n\n\nTh 12:50-1:50 PM\nCSB 243\n\n\nTA\nShubham Kulkarni\n\nF 12-1PM\nCSB 114\n\n\nIAs\nChristian Kim\n\nTh 11AM-12PM\nCSB 114\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nProgram at the introductory level in the R statistical programming language\nEmploy the tidyverse suite of packages to interact with, wrangle, visualize, and model data\nExplain & apply statistical concepts (estimation, linear regression, logistic regression, etc.) for data analysis\nCommunicate data science projects through effective visualization, oral presentation, and written reports\n\n\n\nTexts\nTexts are freely available online:\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics\nÇetinkaya-Rundel and Hardin\nOpenIntro, 1st Edition, 2021\n\n\nR for Data Science\nGrolemund and Wickham\nO’Reilly, 1st edition, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\nYou should have access to a laptop and bring it to every class, fully charged (as possible).\nNote: If you do not have consistent access to the technology needed, please use this form to request a loaner laptop.

    "text": "Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. The article titled, “Beauty in the classroom: instructors’ pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity” (Hamermesh and Parker, 2005) found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher instructional ratings.\n\n\nDaniel S. Hamermesh, Amy Parker, Beauty in the classroom: instructors pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity, Economics of Education Review, Volume 24, Issue 4, August 2005, Pages 369-376, ISSN 0272-7757, 10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.07.013. link.\nFor this assignment you will analyze the data from this study in order to learn what goes into a positive professor evaluation.\nThe data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, six students rated the professors’ physical appearance. (This is a slightly modified version of the original data set that was released as part of the replication data for Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Gelman and Hill, 2007).) The result is a data frame where each row contains a different course and columns represent variables about the courses and professors."

The rowwise function works a lot like group_by, except it groups the data frame one row at a time so that any operations applied to the data frame is done once per each row. This is helpful for finding the mean beauty score for each row. However in the remainder of the analysis we don’t want to, say, calculate summary statistics for each row, or fit a model for each row. Hence we need to undo the effect of rowwise, which we can do with ungroup."

    "section": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?",
    "text": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n\nExercise 3\nWhy do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\nThe mean is more affected by the presence of outliers and by the skew of the distribution. Thus, the presence of a single person with very high income can increase the mean substantively, such that it’s no longer a good impression of the overall distribution. In contrast, the median (or the “middle number”) tells us the income exactly in the middle of the distribution.\n\n\nExercise 4\nTry binwidths of $1000 and $5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the geom_histogram function. So to specify a binwidth of $1000, you would use geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000).\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5000)\n\n\n\n\nI ended up choosing binwidth=5000. When binwidth=1000, there were too many small differences in income that were thus not grouped together, and it was harder to see the overall shape of the distribution.\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function:\n\ncollege_recent_grads |>\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n    min    max   mean   med     sd    q1    q3\n  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 22000 110000 40151. 36000 11470. 33000 45000\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nBased on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.\nThe underlying distribution of median incomes is somewhat right-skewed, with at least 1-2 majors making a lot of money. Because of this, I’m going to use the median median income.\nIt would be probably be fine to use the mean median income as well—judging by the distribution of median incomes in each major_category, which are relatively normal-ish.\n\n\nExercise 6\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in the earlier exercise.\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ major_category, ncol = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nWhich major category has the highest typical (you’ll need to decide what this means) median income? Use the partial code below, filling it in with the appropriate statistic and function. Also note that we are looking for the highest statistic, so make sure to arrange in the correct direction.\n\ncollege_recent_grads |>\n  group_by(major_category) |>\n  summarise(median = median(median)) |>\n  arrange(desc(median))\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 2\n   major_category                      median\n   <chr>                                <dbl>\n 1 Engineering                          57000\n 2 Computers & Mathematics              45000\n 3 Business                             40000\n 4 Physical Sciences                    39500\n 5 Social Science                       38000\n 6 Biology & Life Science               36300\n 7 Law & Public Policy                  36000\n 8 Agriculture & Natural Resources      35000\n 9 Communications & Journalism          35000\n10 Health                               35000\n11 Industrial Arts & Consumer Services  35000\n12 Interdisciplinary                    35000\n13 Education                            32750\n14 Humanities & Liberal Arts            32000\n15 Arts                                 30750\n16 Psychology & Social Work             30000\n\n\nEngineering.\n\n\nExercise 8\nWhich major category is the least popular in this sample?

If you’re not sure where to start, the DatatoViz resource is a great place to help with ideas! If you’re still struggling, be sure when we get to case studies to really think to yourself for each plot, why did prof choose this plot? Could another have been better? And, discuss with your teammates (once you have those)!\n\n\nQ: maybe i missed it… but i am confused about the difference between “count” and “proportions”. Would they end up being the same thing? is the code different for doing count vs. proportion?\nA: Another student had this question, and it’s a good one! Count is for the value across the dataset. Proportions are calculated within the group, such that each group’s values are displayed out of 100%. Happy to discuss more if there are questions. We’ll see an example of this in today’s lecture!\n\n\nQ: Not the lecture, but the way to think in the way to get the “right” plot for the data.\nA: So, the good news is that there isn’t typically one right way. There’s room for personalization, personal preferences, and sometimes, there’s just more than one way! The bad news is that it takes time to learn best practices…but that’s part of what this class is all about!\n\n\nQ: Why is ChatGPT mentioned in the lab answers?\nA: Because I assume that some students are using this as a resource. And, that’s great! It’s there so that you get a sense of ChatGPT’s strengths (sometimes it really does give helpful dplyr code or get you started on the right path) and its weaknesses (it’s still important to think critically if you’re choosing to use it as a tool!) ChatGPT is by no means required in this course. In fact, I think labs/assignments may take longer if you are using it.

If you’re not sure where to start, the DatatoViz resource is a great place to help with ideas! If you’re still struggling, be sure when we get to case studies to really think to yourself for each plot, why did prof choose this plot? Could another have been better? And, discuss with your teammates (once you have those)!\n\n\nQ: maybe i missed it… but i am confused about the difference between “count” and “proportions”. Would they end up being the same thing? is the code different for doing count vs. proportion?\nA: Another student had this question, and it’s a good one! Count is for the value across the dataset. Proportions are calculated within the group, such that each group’s values are displayed out of 100%. Happy to discuss more if there are questions. We’ll see an example of this in today’s lecture!\n\n\nQ: Not the lecture, but the way to think in the way to get the “right” plot for the data.\nA: So, the good news is that there isn’t typically one right way. There’s room for personalization, personal preferences, and sometimes, there’s just more than one way! The bad news is that it takes time to learn best practices…but that’s part of what this class is all about!\n\n\nQ: Why is ChatGPT mentioned in the lab answers?\nA: Because I assume that some students are using this as a resource. And, that’s great! It’s there so that you get a sense of ChatGPT’s strengths (sometimes it really does give helpful dplyr code or get you started on the right path) and its weaknesses (it’s still important to think critically if you’re choosing to use it as a tool!) ChatGPT is by no means required in this course. In fact, I think labs/assignments may take longer if you are using it. I don’t have a sense yet who would learn the material better!"

A skeptical approach is always warranted."
