Place any relevant R code in a code chunk, any relevant text outside of code chunks, and hit Knit HTML.\nSome define statistics as the field that focuses on turning information into knowledge. The first step in that process is to summarize and describe raw information - the data. In this lab we explore data on college majors and earnings, specifically the data behind the FiveThirtyEight story “The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major”.\nThese data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. While outside the scope of this lab, if you are curious about how raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared, see the code FiveThirtyEight authors used.\nWe should also note that there are many considerations that go into picking a major. Earnings potential and employment prospects are two of them, and they are important, but they don’t tell the whole story. Keep this in mind as you analyze the data."

By default arrange sorts in ascending order, which is what we want here – we’re interested in the major with the lowest unemployment rate.\n\ncollege_recent_grads |>\n  arrange(unemployment_rate)\n\nThis gives us what we wanted, but not in an ideal form. First, the name of the major barely fits on the page. Second, some of the variables are not that useful (e.g. major_code, major_category) and some we might want front and center are not easily viewed (e.g. unemployment_rate).\nWe can use the select function to choose which variables to display, and in which order:\nNote that your output here likely has a whole bunch of decimal places in the unemployment variable? You likely don’t want all those values to be displayed.\nThere are two ways we can address this problem. One would be to round the unemployment_rate variable in the dataset or we can change the number of digits displayed, without touching the input data.\nBelow are instructions for how you would do both of these:\n\nRound unemployment_rate: We create a new variable with the mutate function. In this case, we’re overwriting the existing unemployment_rate variable, by rounding it to 4 decimal places.For example, the call to mutate would be: mutate(unemployment_rate = round(unemployment_rate, digits = 4))\nChange displayed number of digits without touching data: We can add an option to our R Markdown document to change the displayed number of digits in the output. To do so, add a new chunk, and set:\n\n\noptions(digits = 2)\n\nNote that the digits in options is scientific digits, and in round they are decimal places. If you’re thinking “Wouldn’t it be nice if they were consistent?”, you’re right…\nYou don’t need to do both of these; that would be redundant. The next exercise asks you to choose one.\n\nExercise 1\nWhich of these options, changing the input data or altering the number of digits displayed without touching the input data, is the better option?

    "text": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n\n\nA percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: Wikipedia\nThere are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: p25th, median, and p75th. These correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.\n\nExercise 3\nWhy do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\nThe question we want to answer “How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?”. We need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by major_category. Then, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups. This decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions. So first, we need to visualize the data.\nWe use the ggplot function to do this. The first argument is the data frame, and the next argument gives the mapping of the variables of the data to the aesthetic elements of the plot.\nLet’s start simple and take a look at the distribution of all median incomes, without considering the major categories.\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nAlong with the plot, we get a message:\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\nThis is telling us that we might want to reconsider the binwidth we chose for our histogram – or more accurately, the binwidth we didn’t specify. It’s good practice to always think in the context of the data and try out a few binwidths before settling on a binwidth. You might ask yourself: “What would be a meaningful difference in median incomes?” $1 is obviously too little, $10000 might be too high.\n\n\nExercise 4\nTry binwidths of $1000 and $5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the geom_histogram function. So to specify a binwidth of $1000, you would use geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000).\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function. Note here that you can calculate multiple summary statistics within a single summarise call:\n\ncollege_recent_grads |>\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nBased on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.\n\n\nExercise 6\nNow, plot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in the earlier exercise.\nNow that we’ve seen the shapes of the distributions of median incomes for each major category, we should have a better idea for which summary statistic to use to quantify the typical median income.\n\n\nExercise 7\nWhich major category has the highest typical (you’ll need to decide what this means) median income? Also note that we are looking for the highest statistic, so make sure if you arrange to do so in the correct direction.\n\n\nExercise 8\nWhich major category is the least popular in this sample?"

The rowwise function works a lot like group_by, except it groups the data frame one row at a time so that any operations applied to the data frame is done once per each row. This is helpful for finding the mean beauty score for each row. However in the remainder of the analysis we don’t want to, say, calculate summary statistics for each row, or fit a model for each row. Hence we need to undo the effect of rowwise, which we can do with ungroup."

In this and subsequent labs, there will be less code provided, and it will be up to you to write the requisite code.\nThe goal of this lab is to get you comfortable working with tidy datasets and using dplyr to do so.\n\n\nGetting started\nTo get started, accept the lab02 assignment (link on Canvas), clone the repo (using SSH) into RStudio on datahub. And, then you’re ready to go!\n\n\nPackages\nThe only package required for completion of this lab is tidyverse, as dplyr (which you’ll be using a lot in this lab) is one of the packages in the tidyverse. Be sure to import the tidyverse prior to completing the lab.\n\n\nData\nFor this lab, we’ll be using the storms dataset from the dplyr package, which includes data about a subset of storms from 1975. The description from this dataset states “This data is a subset of the NOAA Atlantic hurricane database best track data, https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat. The data includes the positions and attributes of 198 tropical storms, measured every six hours during the lifetime of a storm.”\nRemember that you can use ?storms to look up the documentation for the dataset. Be sure to read and understand what information is stored in each variable before proceeding. The instructions below are not very guided and will require that you have read and understood the information in the dataset first.\n\n\nExercises\nFor each of the following, write code using dplyr functions to determine the answers to each of the questions. Your responses should include the code, its output, and a few words that answer the question.\nNote that the final two questions are optional. Definitely give them a try, but it’s OK if you don’t have time to figure them out!\n\nExercise 1\nHow many unique hurricanes are included in this dataset?\n\n\nExercise 2\nWhich tropical storm affected the largest area experiencing tropical storm strength winds? And, what was the maximum sustained wind speed for that storm?\n\n\nExercise 3\nAmong all storms in this dataset, in which month are storms most common? Does this depend on the status of the storm? (In other words, are hurricanes more common in certain months than tropical depressions? or tropical storms?)\n\n\nExercise 4\nYour boss asks for the name, year, and status of all category 5 storms that have happened in the 2000s. Carry out the operations that would deliver what they’re looking for.\n\n\nExercise 5\nFilter these data to only include storms that occurred during your lifetime (your code and results may differ from your classmates!). Among storms that have occurred during your lifetime, what’s the mean and median air pressure across all measurements taken?\n\n\nExercise 6\n(optional challenge) Which decade (of the storms included in the dataset) had the largest number of unique reported storms?\n\n\nExercise 7\n(optional challenge) - Among the subset of storms occurring in your lifetime, which storm lasted the longest? Include your code and explain your answer.\nYay, you’re done! Knit your file, commit all remaining changes to your .Rmd and .html files, use the commit message “Done with Lab 2! 💪”, and push. Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo."

Specifically, we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub…and so you do not have to type in your username and password every time you want to communicate with GitHub from RStudio. These steps will be demo-ed during lab and you’ll have time to walk through the steps!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you aren’t able to attend lab and get stuck here, there is a podcast recording from lecture on 9/29 from the COGS 137 Fa21 iteration where you can see these steps demo-ed.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Email and Username\nThe first step requires two pieces of information: your email address and your name.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Terminal pane\nType the following two lines of code, replacing the information in the quotation marks with your info:\n\n\ngit config --global user.email \"your email\"\ngit config --global user.name \"your name\"\n\nFor example, for me these are:\n\ngit config --global user.email \"sellis@ucsd.edu\"\ngit config --global user.name \"Shannon Ellis\"\n\nTo confirm that the changes have been implemented, run the following:\n\ngit config --global user.email\ngit config --global user.name\n\n\n\nStep 2: Generate ssh key\nIn the terminal, you’ll want to generate an ssh key by typing:\n\nssh-keygen\n\nAfter hitting enter/return to execute the above, you’ll press return/enter three times to bypass specifying a location and passphrase.\n\n\nStep 3: Copy your ssh key\nFrom the terminal type:\n\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nYou’ll want to highlight and copy the full result of this command. It will start with ssh-rsa and end with something including dsmlp toward the end.\n\n\nStep 4: Let GitHub know your key\n\nIn your browser, navigate to https://github.com/settings/keys\nClick “New SSH Key”\nSet title to DSMLP\nPaste what you copied in step 3 into the “Key” box\nClick “Add SSH Key”\n\n\n\nStep 5: Finalize\nReturn to the terminal in RStudio and run the following command:\n\nssh git@github.com\n\nYou may see a message like `The authenticity of host … can’t be established`. You can type yes and hit return/enter after doing so if you do.\nYou’ll then see a message like You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. At this point, you’re all set!\nThis will be the only time you have to do this. From here on out, you’ll be able to “communicate” with GitHub from RStudio without typing your username/password."

The different datasets are marked by the dataset variable.\nTo find out more about the dataset, type the following in your Console: ?datasaurus_dozen. A question mark before the name of an object will always bring up its help file.

Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Rmd document and successfully knit it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data <- datasaurus_dozen |>\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |>, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: <-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points,m hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nIf this seems like a lot, it is. And you will learn about the philosophy of building data visualizations in layer in detail next week. For now, follow along with the code that is provided.\nFor the second part of this exercises, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear – it’s dinosaurial!\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let’s calculate correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\nStart with dino_data and calculate a summary statistic that we will call r as the correlation between x and y.\n\ndino_data |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    <dbl>\n1 -0.0645\n\n\nThis is a good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 2”, and push.\n\n\nExercise 3\nPlot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nThis is another good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 3”, and push.\n\n\nExercise 4\nPlot y vs. x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nYou should pause again, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 4”, and push.\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don’t add a legend.\n\n\nExercise 5\nFinally, let’s plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.\n\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients.\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |>\n  group_by(dataset) |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\nYou’re done with the data analysis exercises, but we’d like you to do two more things:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ?(caption)"

To make this easier on yourself, you’ll likely want to find a visualization where the data are readily available. (To get started, FiveThirtyEight makes a lot of the data from their articles available and has many charts in their articles. You are not required to recreate a visualization from FiveThirtyEight; however, if you’re not sure where to start, you have this option.) Your answer should include an image of the original visualization, a reference to the original image (this could simply be a URL), and your code + recreation.\nNotes:\n\nTo insert an image in an RMarkdown document, you can use the syntax ![alt text](path/to/image.png).\nThe R/ggplot2 code to create your visualization cannot already exist on the internet. (For example, choosing to recreate a plot from the R Graph Gallery would not be an option b/c all the code is already there and you wouldn’t learn as much.)\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nBriefly explain what you learned about ggplot2 in the process of re-creating this visualization.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nExplain how your visualization differs from the original (It’s OK if your’s is not a perfect recreation!)"

The idea here is that there is a lot of data all around us and a whole bunch of visualizations. Some of them are really excellent, and some could be improved. Choose a visualization you’ve created in the past OR a visualization you’ve found out in the world that could benefit from a redesign and/or significant visual improvement.

    "section": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?",
    "text": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n\nExercise 3\nWhy do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\nThe mean is more affected by the presence of outliers and by the skew of the distribution. Thus, the presence of a single person with very high income can increase the mean substantively, such that it’s no longer a good impression of the overall distribution. In contrast, the median (or the “middle number”) tells us the income exactly in the middle of the distribution.\n\n\nExercise 4\nTry binwidths of $1000 and $5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the geom_histogram function. So to specify a binwidth of $1000, you would use geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000).\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5000)\n\n\n\n\nI ended up choosing binwidth=5000. When binwidth=1000, there were too many small differences in income that were thus not grouped together, and it was harder to see the overall shape of the distribution.\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function:\n\ncollege_recent_grads |>\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n    min    max   mean   med     sd    q1    q3\n  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 22000 110000 40151. 36000 11470. 33000 45000\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nBased on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.\nThe underlying distribution of median incomes is somewhat right-skewed, with at least 1-2 majors making a lot of money. Because of this, I’m going to use the median median income.\nIt would be probably be fine to use the mean median income as well—judging by the distribution of median incomes in each major_category, which are relatively normal-ish.\n\n\nExercise 6\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in the earlier exercise.\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ major_category, ncol = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nWhich major category has the highest typical (you’ll need to decide what this means) median income? Use the partial code below, filling it in with the appropriate statistic and function. Also note that we are looking for the highest statistic, so make sure to arrange in the correct direction.\n\ncollege_recent_grads |>\n  group_by(major_category) |>\n  summarise(median = median(median)) |>\n  arrange(desc(median))\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 2\n   major_category                      median\n   <chr>                                <dbl>\n 1 Engineering                          57000\n 2 Computers & Mathematics              45000\n 3 Business                             40000\n 4 Physical Sciences                    39500\n 5 Social Science                       38000\n 6 Biology & Life Science               36300\n 7 Law & Public Policy                  36000\n 8 Agriculture & Natural Resources      35000\n 9 Communications & Journalism          35000\n10 Health                               35000\n11 Industrial Arts & Consumer Services  35000\n12 Interdisciplinary                    35000\n13 Education                            32750\n14 Humanities & Liberal Arts            32000\n15 Arts                                 30750\n16 Psychology & Social Work             30000\n\n\nEngineering.\n\n\nExercise 8\nWhich major category is the least popular in this sample?

Datahub has already been spotty for me in this course and is notorious for slumping at critical pts in the quarter.\nA: Yup. The same steps can be carried out by downloading RStudio onto your computer and connecting it with GitHub.\n\n\nQ: Should we write in the console or in the rmd file first when writing code?\nA: Great question! I’d suggest starting in the Rmd file and editing there. That way you don’t have to copy+paste once you get it right. It’s already there.\n\n\nQ: How do you take notes for coding classes? I know there are lecture notes available, but how would you recommend taking notes for this class?\nA: I would recommend opening a blank Rmd each day for class and saving it with the lecture number. I’d keep notes and things I tried in that file. But, I wouldn’t copy+paste everything, since the other lecture notes are available."

It feels like we are diving into the content in the labs, but I don’t even feel like I truly understand what I’m doing. It often seems like I’m just copying and pasting code from the website without a clear understanding of the bigger picture. I’m particularly stuck because I feel like I don’t have a solid grasp of the fundamental concepts of coding in R; it feels so new. I understand that the pace of the course may be challenging, but I think a bit more stronger focus on the foundational aspects of coding in R would greatly benefit students like me who are struggling with the content. I’m looking forward to the course and I hope I can grasp the content as we go through the next week. I’m concerned about learning the material and also how that may affect my grade.\n\n\nLet’s see how y’all feel in a week. The first week can be a lot in this course.

It will be happening on Wednesday (10/11) from 6-8pm, at PC Ballroom West\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Is it possible to integrate to github using other systems than datahub? Datahub has already been spotty for me in this course and is notorious for slumping at critical pts in the quarter.\nA: Yup. The same steps can be carried out by downloading RStudio onto your computer and connecting it with GitHub.\n\n\nQ: Should we write in the console or in the rmd file first when writing code?\nA: Great question! I’d suggest starting in the Rmd file and editing there. That way you don’t have to copy+paste once you get it right. It’s already there.\n\n\nQ: How do you take notes for coding classes? I know there are lecture notes available, but how would you recommend taking notes for this class?\nA: I would recommend opening a blank Rmd each day for class and saving it with the lecture number. I’d keep notes and things I tried in that file. But, I wouldn’t copy+paste everything, since the other lecture notes are available.\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nLab 02 due Friday\nHW01 now available; due Monday (10/16; 11:59 PM)\nLecture Participation survey open until Thursday\n\n\nNotes:\n\nLab01 scores and feedback posted\nDatahub: Launch RStudio (possible solution?)\nStaff office hours updated (see Canvas or website)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been struggling to grasp the material in the course. It feels like we are diving into the content in the labs, but I don’t even feel like I truly understand what I’m doing. It often seems like I’m just copying and pasting code from the website without a clear understanding of the bigger picture. I’m particularly stuck because I feel like I don’t have a solid grasp of the fundamental concepts of coding in R; it feels so new. I understand that the pace of the course may be challenging, but I think a bit more stronger focus on the foundational aspects of coding in R would greatly benefit students like me who are struggling with the content. I’m looking forward to the course and I hope I can grasp the content as we go through the next week. I’m concerned about learning the material and also how that may affect my grade.\n\n\nLet’s see how y’all feel in a week. The first week can be a lot in this course.

    "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: I was just wondering if you could still provide those videos you talked about with like syntax stuff so that we can follow along. I would also appreciate if it was really through with like a walk through of how you got to each point\nA: I like this suggestion, and I’ll try to make these. No promises though. Just have to find magical time in the schedule to make them. Note that lectures will be the more detailed walk through with more time on your own to figure it out (rather than detailed walk through outside of class), so you will get the information…the time/location will just differ. But, I’ll try to make some supplemental videos for those interested.\n\n\nQ: Had a question about the modeling and the last bit showing how decreasing the alpha showed greater clustering at the bottom left corner. If the bottom left corner looks like 0 height and 0 width, how does that translate into the dimensions of an actual painting?\nA: Good observation. The follow-up to this is…are there any paintings with zero width or zero height? And, if you dig in the data (i.e. min(pp$Height_in, na.rm=TRUE)), you’ll see that there are some very small paintings, but that none are zero.\n\n\nQ: If we want to built our own model, can we plot them with ggplot2?\nA: Yup! This post starts to get at that. It does so for a linear model, but the logic follows for other models.\n\n\nQ: For the paintings dataset, how could we perform EDA on specific subject matter, like seeing how many portraits include Jesus as part of the subject?\nA: Love this question. There is a whole field of natural language processing that would have sophisticated ways to analyze this. A simple first pass would be to, for example, filter for paintings that include “Jesus” in the subject column.\n\n\nQ: I think the segmented bar plots based on proportion seem difficult to read. I’m not sure why we should be using this instead of the stacked plots?\nA: Grouped bar blots are typically most quickly understood. Proportion stacked plots are then easiest to understand proportion across categories. Stacked plots of raw numbers take longer (for most) to understand and thus are often avoided, but like all viz, it depends on context and audience.\n\n\nQ: In the last lecture, we talked about how segmented bar plots might not be the ideal choice for data visualization, but we still demonstrated them in today’s lecture. So, specifically in what cases should we choose segmented bar plots as a data analysis tool?\nA: They can be helpful when the audience is familiar with them, but typically are most helpful when you want to display relative proportions rather than counts"

    "text": "Q: I was just wondering if you could still provide those videos you talked about with like syntax stuff so that we can follow along. I would also appreciate if it was really through with like a walk through of how you got to each point\nA: I like this suggestion, and I’ll try to make these. No promises though. Just have to find magical time in the schedule to make them. Note that lectures will be the more detailed walk through with more time on your own to figure it out (rather than detailed walk through outside of class), so you will get the information…the time/location will just differ. But, I’ll try to make some supplemental videos for those interested.\n\n\nQ: Had a question about the modeling and the last bit showing how decreasing the alpha showed greater clustering at the bottom left corner. If the bottom left corner looks like 0 height and 0 width, how does that translate into the dimensions of an actual painting?\nA: Good observation. The follow-up to this is…are there any paintings with zero width or zero height? And, if you dig in the data (i.e. min(pp$Height_in, na.rm=TRUE)), you’ll see that there are some very small paintings, but that none are zero.\n\n\nQ: If we want to built our own model, can we plot them with ggplot2?\nA: Yup! This post starts to get at that. It does so for a linear model, but the logic follows for other models.\n\n\nQ: For the paintings dataset, how could we perform EDA on specific subject matter, like seeing how many portraits include Jesus as part of the subject?\nA: Love this question. There is a whole field of natural language processing that would have sophisticated ways to analyze this. A simple first pass would be to, for example, filter for paintings that include “Jesus” in the subject column.\n\n\nQ: I think the segmented bar plots based on proportion seem difficult to read. I’m not sure why we should be using this instead of the stacked plots?\nA: Grouped bar blots are typically most quickly understood. Proportion stacked plots are then easiest to understand proportion across categories. Stacked plots of raw numbers take longer (for most) to understand and thus are often avoided, but like all viz, it depends on context and audience.\n\n\nQ: In the last lecture, we talked about how segmented bar plots might not be the ideal choice for data visualization, but we still demonstrated them in today’s lecture. So, specifically in what cases should we choose segmented bar plots as a data analysis tool?\nA: They can be helpful when the audience is familiar with them, but typically are most helpful when you want to display relative proportions rather than counts\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nLab 04 due Friday\n\nModel Interpretations\nText, code, & viz all matter\n\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class\nHW02 due Monday (10/30; 11:59 PM)\ndiscuss displaying image in Markdown\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Models\n\nQuantitative Predictor\nCategorical Predictor (2 & >2 levels)\nresiduals\ndata transformations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR4DS Chapter 24: Model Building\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics Chapter 7: Linear Regression with a Single Predictor"

I didn’t understand what made them so different\nA: You’re right that they’re very similar and can even at times be used/coerced to do what the other does. Basically, if you want a 2D comparison (variable1 x variable2), facet_grid. If you just want to break down the plots by a single variable, facet_wrap.\n\n\nQ: Will future HW assignments also include things that were not explicitly covered in class? For example, HW1 which was due last night, included concepts and materials that were just covered today.\nA: Nope. That was my fault. We were behind where I intended to be. This will not be an issue going forward.\n\n\nQ: can we plot data from 2 separate data frames somehow?\nA: Not typically in ggplot2. Instead, data would have to be wrangled into the tidy format (single dataset) first.\n\n\nQ: does filling= mean seperate and color by the value passed in, and we don’t need to assign color again? What if we don’t want color?\nA: Fill indicates how to fill the plot with color. If you don’t want color, you wouldn’t use fill\n\n\nQ: How we would do the second suggestion in how to visualize the brexit data differently?\nA: We’ll do this together today!\n\n\nQ: for datasets that are included in a library (like penguins one), could we read it into a df to see it in the environment? or is that redundant and we should only view it, use functions to see var names, etc\nA: That would be ok!\n\n\nQ: I was wondering where I can find all available themes.\nA: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html\n\n\nQ: I have heard about plotly before. I was wondering what will be its difference between this and ggplot?\nA: There is a ggplotly package! Plotly enables interaction on top of ggplot2 packages"

    "text": "Q: I was most confused about the differences between facet_wrap and facet_grid. I didn’t understand what made them so different\nA: You’re right that they’re very similar and can even at times be used/coerced to do what the other does. Basically, if you want a 2D comparison (variable1 x variable2), facet_grid. If you just want to break down the plots by a single variable, facet_wrap.\n\n\nQ: Will future HW assignments also include things that were not explicitly covered in class? For example, HW1 which was due last night, included concepts and materials that were just covered today.\nA: Nope. That was my fault. We were behind where I intended to be. This will not be an issue going forward.\n\n\nQ: can we plot data from 2 separate data frames somehow?\nA: Not typically in ggplot2. Instead, data would have to be wrangled into the tidy format (single dataset) first.\n\n\nQ: does filling= mean seperate and color by the value passed in, and we don’t need to assign color again? What if we don’t want color?\nA: Fill indicates how to fill the plot with color. If you don’t want color, you wouldn’t use fill\n\n\nQ: How we would do the second suggestion in how to visualize the brexit data differently?\nA: We’ll do this together today!\n\n\nQ: for datasets that are included in a library (like penguins one), could we read it into a df to see it in the environment? or is that redundant and we should only view it, use functions to see var names, etc\nA: That would be ok!\n\n\nQ: I was wondering where I can find all available themes.\nA: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html\n\n\nQ: I have heard about plotly before. I was wondering what will be its difference between this and ggplot?\nA: There is a ggplotly package!

Preferences of developers? I think we’ll get there…\n\n\nQ: Wasn’t clear about the ‘single quotes’ vs “double quotes” thing\nA: When creating a string, or any time you need to use quotes in R, single and double quotes are interchangeable. R doesn’t care which you use. However, your code will be stylistically better if you consistently use one.\n\n\nQ: What are useful libraries that we can use to analyze data?\nA: We’ll be discussing lots, but the tidyverse packages (the first of which we’ll discuss is dplyr) is a great place to start. There are also different packages for basically every statistical analysis out there\n\n\nQ: Is there any way to prevent coercion? / I was wondering if you can types cast a variable when concatenation\nA: Yup. You can explicitly state as._____() when creating a variable (i.e. as.character()) and when reading in data you can specify. You’ll find that R does a pretty good job at guessing, but we can always fix to what we want after the fact.\n\n\nQ: What is the difference between mylist[1] and mylist[[1]]? It looked like class(mylist[1]) returned list and class(mylist[[1]]) returned the class of the element.\nA: Double brackets returns the element directly. Single bracket (for lists) always returns a list.\n\n\nQ: I’m curious about how to handle dataframes in R\nA: Excellent - we’ll start this discussion today and continue throughout the quarter!"

Preferences of developers? I think we’ll get there…\n\n\nQ: Wasn’t clear about the ‘single quotes’ vs “double quotes” thing\nA: When creating a string, or any time you need to use quotes in R, single and double quotes are interchangeable. R doesn’t care which you use. However, your code will be stylistically better if you consistently use one.\n\n\nQ: What are useful libraries that we can use to analyze data?\nA: We’ll be discussing lots, but the tidyverse packages (the first of which we’ll discuss is dplyr) is a great place to start. There are also different packages for basically every statistical analysis out there\n\n\nQ: Is there any way to prevent coercion? / I was wondering if you can types cast a variable when concatenation\nA: Yup. You can explicitly state as._____() when creating a variable (i.e. as.character()) and when reading in data you can specify. You’ll find that R does a pretty good job at guessing, but we can always fix to what we want after the fact.\n\n\nQ: What is the difference between mylist[1] and mylist[[1]]? It looked like class(mylist[1]) returned list and class(mylist[[1]]) returned the class of the element.\nA: Double brackets returns the element directly. Single bracket (for lists) always returns a list.\n\n\nQ: I’m curious about how to handle dataframes in R\nA: Excellent - we’ll start this discussion today and continue throughout the quarter!\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nLab 01 due tomorrow (Friday; 11:59 PM)\nStudent survey open until next Thursday\nHW01 and Lab02 will both be released Monday\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class\n\n\n\n\nR4DS:\n\nChapter 5: Data Transformation\nChapter 15: Factors\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\n\nphilosophy\npipes\ncommon operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges\n\n\n\nSource: dplyr.tidyverse.org"

Historically, factors were much easier to work with than character vectors, so many base R functions automatically convert character vectors to factors.\nfactors are still useful when you have true categorical data, and when you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display. The goal of the forcats package is to provide a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors.\n\n\n\nSource: forcats.tidyverse.org"

    "text": "Q&A\nQ: How are groups formed for the projects?\nA: I form them randomly for the two case studies and students get to choose their own groups for the final project.\nQ: I’m curious about what the workload would be like for the case studies.\nA: We’ll discuss this when the time comes in detail but for now, students are presented with a lot of the starter code for the case studies. You and your group mates have to get teh code running, add explanations, and “extend” the case study, meaning add something meaningful onto what was presented.\nQ: Will this course go into advanced topics in tidyverse?\nA: We will certainly go beyond the basic dplyr verbs and cover multiple packages in the tidyverse, but we won’t be able to cover everything.\nQ: Would it be possible to have access to the third Case Study just to work on our own time?\nA: Yup! I’ll you all in the direction of OpenCaseStudies, which is a resource I’ll be using for 1 of the 2 case studies this quarter, and that we used for all case studies previously.\nQ: How many homework assignments are there? Some slides said 3, some said 4.\nA: Apologies. There are 3. (There were previously 4 but I removed one. Slides have been updated.)\nQ: Could we just sit in for lectures? Can I keep watching lectures?\nA: Yup - this would be fine, so long as everyone enrolled had a seat. And, the podcasts are open to anyone!\nQ: If we decide to do our projects and homework locally, how can we download/install the packages necessary for it?\nA: This is covered in your first lab!\nQ: I’m generally curious on how the language R is used in real world settings after college. What are its specific uses and what are the better ways to learn the language to maximize its utility. Also, how does this language differ from python in the data science realm.\nA: Great question that we’ll cover throughout the course. However, breifly here, R is most heavily used by individuals who do more statistics, who work in biology, psychology or economics, and/or who analyze data regularly.\nQ: What is the advantage of using R over other programming languages to do data science tasks? How much is R used for data science in the real world?\nA: Within the tidyverse and in RStudio, the advantage is the cohesiveness of the tools - once you gain familiarity you can often intuit how to use another tool in the tidyverse. R is used for data science across tons of companies; however, across industries. its use is not as widespread as Python."

Last Fall we helped nearly 10,000 students register to vote in California and got the UCs to release new policy to phase out single-use plastics to protect our oceans! SIGN UP TO HELP NOW\nNow, we are working to tackle the biggest problem facing our generation - climate change. Coming off another record-setting summer of hot temperatures, it’s clear we need to take strong, swift action to reduce the impacts of climate change. That’s why we are building support from students across the state to call for 100% clean energy UC-wide - for cars, buses, buildings, lights, and more! Fill out this interest form to learn more!\nAs a volunteer or intern with CALPIRG you can:\nWork with the media and help organize events like a Solar-Powered Concert and climate week of action\nIncrease voting accessibility and voter turnout in elections\nBring down the cost of textbooks\nProtect wildlife like whales and sea otters in the Pacific\nAnd more!\n\n\n\n\nQ: How are groups formed for the projects?\nA: I form them randomly for the two case studies and students get to choose their own groups for the final project.\nQ: I’m curious about what the workload would be like for the case studies.\nA: We’ll discuss this when the time comes in detail but for now, students are presented with a lot of the starter code for the case studies. You and your group mates have to get teh code running, add explanations, and “extend” the case study, meaning add something meaningful onto what was presented.\nQ: Will this course go into advanced topics in tidyverse?\nA: We will certainly go beyond the basic dplyr verbs and cover multiple packages in the tidyverse, but we won’t be able to cover everything.\nQ: Would it be possible to have access to the third Case Study just to work on our own time?\nA: Yup! I’ll you all in the direction of OpenCaseStudies, which is a resource I’ll be using for 1 of the 2 case studies this quarter, and that we used for all case studies previously.\nQ: How many homework assignments are there? Some slides said 3, some said 4.\nA: Apologies. There are 3. (There were previously 4 but I removed one. Slides have been updated.)\nQ: Could we just sit in for lectures? Can I keep watching lectures?\nA: Yup - this would be fine, so long as everyone enrolled had a seat. And, the podcasts are open to anyone!\nQ: If we decide to do our projects and homework locally, how can we download/install the packages necessary for it?\nA: This is covered in your first lab!\nQ: I’m generally curious on how the language R is used in real world settings after college. What are its specific uses and what are the better ways to learn the language to maximize its utility. Also, how does this language differ from python in the data science realm.\nA: Great question that we’ll cover throughout the course. However, breifly here, R is most heavily used by individuals who do more statistics, who work in biology, psychology or economics, and/or who analyze data regularly.\nQ: What is the advantage of using R over other programming languages to do data science tasks? How much is R used for data science in the real world?\nA: Within the tidyverse and in RStudio, the advantage is the cohesiveness of the tools - once you gain familiarity you can often intuit how to use another tool in the tidyverse. R is used for data science across tons of companies; however, across industries. its use is not as widespread as Python.\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nStudent survey “due” today 11:59 PM\nLab 01 due Friday (11:59 PM)\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class\n\nWaitlist (Non)Update: Staff are seeing what options there are.

The levels of a factor are all the possible unique values in a variable.\n\n\nQ: how similar is R to numpy/which scenarios are each used in the industry?\nA: Basically, anything data science-y you can do in R, you can also do in python. R has linear algebra/working with matrices built directly into its base installation, so no additional package would be need for numpy-like operations. And, dplyr does very similar things to pandas, but with a more readable and consistent syntax overall.\n\n\nQ: would we ever load just dplyr instead of the entire tidyverse package? is there a big difference?\nA: We’ll always just load tidyverse. The difference is that the tidyverse is quite big, so if you ever wanted to just use dplyr functions, you could load just that. This matters more in development where you’re trying to minimize external dependencies and make code run as fast as possible. For our purposes, there’s no real need to only load dplyr\n\n\nQ: I found the demos to be the most confusing part, because it’s very different understanding slides and applying that to actual coding. Personally, I would prefer if the lecture content were put into recordings, or just uploaded earlier so we could learn it on our own, and then have classes be more focused on data science best practices, applications, etc.\nA: I do really like this idea and would love to run this like this in the. I’m curious what y’all think of this and will add a question like this to the post-course survey to get students’ thoughts."

    "text": "Q: What is the difference between pull and select?\nA: select specifies which columns to display in your resulting dataframe. pull extracts the values from a column and stores them in a vector (not a dataframe)\n\n\nQ: I am a bit confused on factors and what levels mean.\nA: Factors store categorical information. The levels of a factor are all the possible unique values in a variable.\n\n\nQ: how similar is R to numpy/which scenarios are each used in the industry?\nA: Basically, anything data science-y you can do in R, you can also do in python. R has linear algebra/working with matrices built directly into its base installation, so no additional package would be need for numpy-like operations. And, dplyr does very similar things to pandas, but with a more readable and consistent syntax overall.\n\n\nQ: would we ever load just dplyr instead of the entire tidyverse package? is there a big difference?\nA: We’ll always just load tidyverse. The difference is that the tidyverse is quite big, so if you ever wanted to just use dplyr functions, you could load just that. This matters more in development where you’re trying to minimize external dependencies and make code run as fast as possible. For our purposes, there’s no real need to only load dplyr\n\n\nQ: I found the demos to be the most confusing part, because it’s very different understanding slides and applying that to actual coding. Personally, I would prefer if the lecture content were put into recordings, or just uploaded earlier so we could learn it on our own, and then have classes be more focused on data science best practices, applications, etc.\nA: I do really like this idea and would love to run this like this in the. I’m curious what y’all think of this and will add a question like this to the post-course survey to get students’ thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nLab 02 due Friday (11:59 PM)\nHW 01 due Monday (11:59 PM)\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class\n\n\n\n\n\nR4DS Chapter 3: Data Visualization\nData to Viz: https://www.data-to-viz.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is tidyverse’s data visualization package\nStructure of the code for plots can be summarized as\n\n\nggplot(data = [dataset], \n       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], \n                     y = [y-variable])) +\n   geom_xxx() +\n   other options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nglimpse(penguins)\n\nRows: 344\nColumns: 8\n$ species           <fct> Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adel…\n$ island            <fct> Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ bill_length_mm    <dbl> 39.1, 39.5, 40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3, 38.9, 39.2, 34.1, …\n$ bill_depth_mm     <dbl> 18.7, 17.4, 18.0, NA, 19.3, 20.6, 17.8, 19.6, 18.1, …\n$ flipper_length_mm <int> 181, 186, 195, NA, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190, 186…\n$ body_mass_g       <int> 3750, 3800, 3250, NA, 3450, 3650, 3625, 4675, 3475, …\n$ sex               <fct> male, female, female, NA, female, male, female, male…\n$ year              <int> 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst \n\n\n\n\npenguins |>\n  datatable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm,\n                     color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Bill depth and length\",\n       subtitle = \"Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins\",\n       x = \"Bill depth (mm)\", y = \"Bill length (mm)\",\n       color = \"Species\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`)."

    "text": "Course Info\nPractical Data Science in R focuses on teaching students how to think rigorously throughout the data science process. To this end, through interaction with unique data sets and interesting questions, this course helps students 1) gain fluency in the R programming language, 2) effectively explore & visualize data, 3) use statistical thinking to analyze data and rigorously evaluate their conclusions, and 4) effectively communicate their results. Course objectives are accomplished through hands-on practice, using real-world data to learn via case studies, and project-based learning.\n\nDays & Times\n\n\n\n\n\n Lecture: Tu/Th 2-3:20 (MOS 0204)\n Lab: Fri 3-3:50 (Peterson Hall 102)\n\nInstructional Staff & Office Hours\n\n\n\nInstructor\nShannon Ellis\nsellis@ucsd.edu\nWed 11-12\nZoom by appt.

This course website was adapted from her course website. These course slides/labs/homework…also adapted from Mine’s course and the related datascienceinabox. I am so *very* indebted to Mine! I also want to thank the Open Case Studies team for their tireless work in putting together interesting and topical case studies, a handful of which we use throughout the course. And, finally, thanks to Allison Horst, whose artwork is inspiring, educational, and fun…and is used throughout this course. Further, thanks to the R (education) community generally; planning this course was really fun because I had so many awesome resources to choose from. Having these materials made course prep and planning is just another example of what sets the R community apart!"

    "text": "Class\nClass will include short lectures as well as interactive activities. The goal of lecture is to introduce the topics and information needed for the course. The goal of your time outside of lecture is to practice with topics that are introduced and deepen your understanding of material presented in class. Since so much of programming and statistical analysis is learned best by doing, we’ll prioritize that throughout the course, both in and outside of the classroom.\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\nMy goal is that every student, regardless of their background or perspective, will be well-served by this course. My philosophy is that the diversity of students in this class is a huge asset to our learning community; our differences provide opportunities for learning and understanding. I intend to present course materials that are conscious of and respectful to diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, politics, and culture); however, if I ever fall short or if you ever have suggestions for improvement, please do share with me! This feedback is always welcomed, and I am always in the process of learning and improving to this end. If you would like to provide that feedback anonymously, please use the anonymous Google Form.*\n\nWhat should you call me?\nMost students call me Professor/Prof Ellis, and that’s great! This is how I typically sign emails to students. I’m also totally OK with you addressing me as Shannon or Dr. Ellis.\n\n\nWhat I should call you?\nI should call you by your preferred name, with the correct pronunciation. Please correct me (in the moment or via email/Piazza after the fact…however you’re most comfortable) if I ever make a mistake.\n\n\n\nDisability Access\nStudents requesting accommodations due to a disability should provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. If you are struggling to get necessary accommodations or want to further discuss your accommodations, please feel free to reach out to Professor Ellis directly.\nContacting the OSD can help you further:\n858.534.4382 (phone)\nosd@ucsd.edu (email)\nhttp://disabilities.ucsd.edu\n\n\nHow to get help\nIt’s great that we have so many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. When in doubt, Piazza is great!\nMore specifically, if you have:\n\nquestions about course content - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so either ask them in class (which is recorded) and/or post these to Piazza!\na technical assignment question - come to office hours (or post to Piazza). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished ‘in person’ where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. However, if that is not possible, post your question to Piazza. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask. And, for those answering, help your classmates as much as you can without just giving the answer. Help guide them, point them in a direction, provide pseudo code, but do not provide code that answers assignment questions.\nquestions about course logistics - first, check the course website. If you can’t find the answer there, first ask a classmate. If still unsure, post on Piazza.\nquestions about a grade - Post on Piazza with “regrades” tag in a private post to “Instructors & TAs”.\nsomething super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth - feel free to email Professor Ellis (sellis@ucsd.edu) or come to office hours. Please include COGS137 in the email subject line.\nsome feedback about the course you want to share anonymously - If you’ve been offended by an example in class, really liked or disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn’t but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the anonymous Google Form*\n\n*This form can be taken down at any time if it’s not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nDon’t cheat.\nYou are generally encouraged to work together and help one another in this course. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. A helpful heuristic can be to ask yourself “Can I explain each piece of code and each analysis carried out in what I’m submitting? Could I reproduce this code/analysis on my own?”; you should be able to answer “Yes” to both questions for everything you submit in this course. For labs and assignments, you are allowed and encouraged to work together, but it is your responsibility to ensure you understand everything you’ve submitted. (For the midterm, all work has to be completed individually and communication with other humans about the exam is not allowed; this will be discussed more explicitly beforehand.)\nA note on sharing / reusing code: The Internet is an excellent resource; there will be many times you find helpful information online. You should use available resources (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot, StackOverflow, etc.), but you must explicitly cite any code you use directly or any code you use as inspiration. This can be done by including the URL/reference to the source directly in your code (as a code comment) or in accompanying text for a given assignment/exam/lab. You should never share code directly (e.g. copy + paste; share an send an answer to a classmate), but you can discuss code and work together on everything other than take-home exams.\nPlease review UCSD’s academic integrity policies here.\nCheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, Canvas or DataHub is down or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact Professor Ellis by emailing (sellis@ucsd.edu) your assignment as soon as possible to avoid it being graded as late.\n\n\nCourse components\n\nLecture\nLectures will be your introduction to course topics and material. Lectures will be interactive, and you will be given time to practice with the lecture concepts during class. Attendance is not required, but is encouraged if you’re feeling well. To help incentivize coming to class, there will be a daily participation survey that will open at the end of lecture and close shortly after each Tues/Thurs lecture. Each time you fill out the lecture survey, you get a small % of credit toward your final project Completion of all surveys can provide up to 3.5% extra credit on your final project (not your final course grade).\n\nReadings\nReadings will be assigned for some class days and are best completed prior to the day’s lecture. These are meant to provide background and additional context for the upcoming day’s lecture topics. These can also be a good source after class when studying or reviewing topics discussed in class.\n\n\nPodcast\nIn case you miss class or would like to review the material covered in class, you can view the podcasts here.\n\n\n\nLabs (16%)\nLabs are meant to give you deeper understanding and hands-on experience with the technical and statistical topics introduced during lecture in a low-stakes environment. Lab sections will typically comprise of a short review and explanation of the lab and then time for you to complete the assigned weekly lab. Labs are submitted individually, but you are encouraged to work together during lab. You are free to ask and answer each others’ questions and discuss your work. Instructional staff will be present during lab to help further your understanding.\nLabs are graded for concerted effort. This is because when we learn something new, mistakes are going to happen! In fact, we learn a lot from the mistakes we make during the learning process. If your submission reflects ~50 min of work/effort, you will receive full credit for the week’s lab.\nLab attendance is not required, but is definitely encouraged if you are feeling well. While slides used are shared, lab sessions are not recorded, so being present is the best way to fully engage in the course.\n\n\nHomework (24%)\nAfter practice in lecture and labs, homework assignments are meant to demonstrate your solidified understanding of the course material. These are typically 2-4x longer and more involved than labs. Homework assignments are completed and submitted individually and are marked for correctness. You are allowed to work together on homework assignments, but academic integrity must be upheld.\n\n\nMidterm (15%)\nThere will be a single take-home midterm, and you will have at least 48 hours to complete it. This exam is meant to assess your understanding of the R programming language prior to us moving into focusing on case studies and full analyses. The exam will be completed individually and will be open-notes and open-Internet; however, you will not be permitted to ask questions of one another or instructional staff while completing the take-home exam.\n\n\nTeams\nThere will be two case study mini-projects and a final project. Teams will be randomly assigned for the mini-projects but you will choose your final project groups. (By working with teammates throughout the course, you will also be able to use one another as a resource during labs and assignments.)\n\n\nCase Study Mini-projects (25%)\nStarting week 5, we will transition to a project-based course. This will allow us to use case studies to focus on deepening statistical knowledge and carrying out interesting analyses. In this, specific case studies and statistics topics will be discussed in class. In your teams and for each of the case studies, you will: 1) extend the analysis from class and 2) communicate your findings for both a technical and general audience.\n\n\nFinal Project (20%)\nThe final project will be completed in groups. There will be two different general final projects from which your group can choose, but the idea is that whichever you choose, you will be able to tackle it using and building upon the tools and techniques discussed in class. Briefly here, the two options will be: 1. Create a technical presentation on a statistics topic and/or an R package. 2. Carry out a data analysis.\nEach will require a written technical report, a communication to a general audience, and an oral presentation, but the specific requirements will differ between the two.\nFinal Project groups will have to submit a proposal during week 8 (2%). Final projects (18%) will be due on Tues of finals week at 11:59 PM.\n\n\n\nGrading\nYour final grade will be comprised of the following:\n\n\n\nLabs (8)\n16%\n\n\nHomework (3)\n24%\n\n\nMidterm (1)\n15%\n\n\nCase Study Projects* (2)\n25%\n\n\nFinal Project* (Proposal + Project)\n20%\n\n\n\n* indicates group submission\n\nFinal Grades\nTo calculate final grades, I use the standard grading scale and do not round grades up (given the numerous extra credit opportunities offered):\n\n\n\n97-100%\nA+\n\n\n93-96%\nA\n\n\n90-92%\nA-\n\n\n87-89%\nB+\n\n\n83-86%\nB\n\n\n80-82%\nB-\n\n\n77-79%\nC+\n\n\n73-76%\nC\n\n\n70-72%\nC-\n\n\n67-69%\nD+\n\n\n63-66%\nD\n\n\n60-62%\nD-\n\n\n<60%\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate / missed work\nLate homework assignments and case study projects will be accepted up to 3 days (72 hours) after the assigned deadline. Late submissions will receive a 25% deduction.\nThere are no late deadlines for labs, the exam, or the final project.\nNote: Prof Ellis is a reasonable person; reach out to her if you have an extenuating circumstance at any point in the quarter.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nWe will work hard to grade everyone fairly and return assignments quickly. And, we know you also work hard and want you to receive the grade you’ve earned. Occasionally, grading mistakes do happen, and it’s important to us to correct them. If you think there is a mistake in your grade on an assignment, post privately on Piazza to “Instructors” using the “regrades” tag within 72 hours. This post should include evidence of why you think your answer was correct and should point to the specific part of the assignment in question.\n\n\nProfessionalism\nPlease refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class. Not only is this distracting to you, but it can also be distracting to those around you. (Note that there is no consequence associated with this. I know it can be difficult, but I ask that you try your best!)"
