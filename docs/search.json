    "text": "Introduction\nIn the first lab, you got acquainted with RMarkdown documents, knitting, code chunks, and interacting with GitHub; however, most of the required code was provided for you. In this and subsequent labs, there will be less code provided, and it will be up to you to write the requisite code.\nThe goal of this lab is to get you comfortable working with tidy datasets and using dplyr to do so.\n\n\nGetting started\nTo get started, accept the lab02 assignment (link on Canvas), clone the repo (using SSH) into RStudio on datahub. And, then you’re ready to go!\n\n\nPackages\nThe only package required for completion of this lab is tidyverse, as dplyr (which you’ll be using a lot in this lab) is one of the packages in the tidyverse. Be sure to import the tidyverse prior to completing the lab.\n\n\nData\nFor this lab, we’ll be using the storms dataset from the dplyr package, which includes data about a subset of storms from 1975. The description from this dataset states “This data is a subset of the NOAA Atlantic hurricane database best track data, https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat. The data includes the positions and attributes of 198 tropical storms, measured every six hours during the lifetime of a storm.”\nRemember that you can use ?storms to look up the documentation for the dataset. Be sure to read and understand what information is stored in each variable before proceeding. The instructions below are not very guided and will require that you have read and understood the information in the dataset first.\n\n\nExercises\nFor each of the following, write code using dplyr functions to determine the answers to each of the questions. Your responses should include the code, its output, and a few words that answer the question.\nNote that the final two questions are optional. Definitely give them a try, but it’s OK if you don’t have time to figure them out!\n\nExercise 1\nHow many unique hurricanes are included in this dataset?\n\n\nExercise 2\nWhich tropical storm affected the largest area experiencing tropical storm strength winds? And, what was the maximum sustained wind speed for that storm?\n\n\nExercise 3\nAmong all storms in this dataset, in which month are storms most common? Does this depend on the status of the storm? (In other words, are hurricanes more common in certain months than tropical depressions? or tropical storms?)\n\n\nExercise 4\nYour boss asks for the name, year, and status of all category 5 storms that have happened in the 2000s. Carry out the operations that would deliver what they’re looking for.\n\n\nExercise 5\nFilter these data to only include storms that occurred during your lifetime (your code and results may differ from your classmates!). Among storms that have occurred during your lifetime, what’s the mean and median air pressure across all measurements taken?\n\n\nExercise 6\n(optional challenge) Which decade (of the storms included in the dataset) had the largest number of unique reported storms?\n\n\nExercise 7\n(optional challenge) - Among the subset of storms occurring in your lifetime, which storm lasted the longest? Include your code and explain your answer.\nYay, you’re done! Knit your file, commit all remaining changes to your .Rmd and .html files, use the commit message “Done with Lab 2! 💪”, and push. Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo."

Actually, this single data frame contains 13 datasets, designed to show us why data visualization is important and how summary statistics alone can be misleading. The different datasets are maked by the dataset variable.\nTo find out more about the dataset, type the following in your Console: ?datasaurus_dozen. A question mark before the name of an object will always bring up its help file. This command must be ran in the Console.\n\nExercise 1\nBased on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the datasaurus_dozen file have? What are the variables included in the data frame? Add your responses to your lab report. When you’re done, commit your changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 1”, and push.\nLet’s take a look at what these datasets are. To do so we can make a frequency table of the dataset variable:\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |>\n  count(dataset)\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 2\n   dataset        n\n   <chr>      <int>\n 1 away         142\n 2 bullseye     142\n 3 circle       142\n 4 dino         142\n 5 dots         142\n 6 h_lines      142\n 7 high_lines   142\n 8 slant_down   142\n 9 slant_up     142\n10 star         142\n11 v_lines      142\n12 wide_lines   142\n13 x_shape      142\n\n\nThe original Datasaurus (dino) was created by Alberto Cairo in this great blog post. The other Dozen were generated using simulated annealing and the process is described in the paper Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice.3 In the paper, the authors simulate a variety of datasets that the same summary statistics to the Datasaurus but have very different distributions."

    "text": "Data visualization and summary\n\nExercise 2\nPlot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Rmd document and successfully knit it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data <- datasaurus_dozen |>\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |>, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: <-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points,m hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nIf this seems like a lot, it is. And you will learn about the philosophy of building data visualizations in layer in detail next week. For now, follow along with the code that is provided.\nFor the second part of this exercises, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear – it’s dinosaurial!\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let’s calculate correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\nStart with dino_data and calculate a summary statistic that we will call r as the correlation between x and y.\n\ndino_data |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    <dbl>\n1 -0.0645\n\n\nThis is a good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 2”, and push.\n\n\nExercise 3\nPlot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nThis is another good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 3”, and push.\n\n\nExercise 4\nPlot y vs. x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nYou should pause again, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 4”, and push.\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don’t add a legend.\n\n\nExercise 5\nFinally, let’s plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.\n\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients.\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |>\n  group_by(dataset) |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\nYou’re done with the data analysis exercises, but we’d like you to do two more things:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ?(caption)"

    "text": "Q: what does |> mean?\nA: It means “and then” and is called a “pipe.” Discussing this in more detail in today’s lecture!\n\n\nQ: I think the lab is much more harder than the lecture.\nA: This first week there is a lot to learn regarding tooling, but once you’ve got that down the “process” of completing a lab will become second nature. Then, it’s just content…and applying something is always more difficult than listening to it being explained. So, labs will be a bit harder than lecture…but that’s by design b/c 1) we grade on effort (it’s ok to be wrong in labs!) and 2) answer keys will be posted (learning from mistakes/places we struggle is a great way to learn!)\n\n\nQ: Just curious about the oral presentation portion of the final project. Will this be a requirement in the form of a recorded video (like in COGS 108), or will we be presenting our project findings live in front of the class on the due date?\nA: There are going to be two options (most likely). A recording will definitely be an option. We’re also hoping to have an option where you can come present live, to the instructional staff and any students who want to learn from one another.\n\n\nQ: I am curious about the similarities and differences between both of Python and R!\nA: Very briefly, some similarities: both are object-oriented programming languages (although R is not only object-oriented); both are great for data analysis; differences: python arguably has a simpler syntax; R is, at its core, designed for statistical analysis so I’d argue it’s better for that; Python is a general-programming language so it’s arguablly better for software development; R has an implementation of the grammar of graphics, so I’d argue it’s better for data visualization (but some would disagree).\n\n\nQ: How can I understand dataframes in R easier?\nA: With practice! Today’s lecture, this week 2 lab, and your first hw will help you get additional practice. Then, we’ll use them throughout the course and build your understanding.\n\n\nQ: For very large data sets, how would you be able to find every type coercion?\nA: Each column would have a single type. glimpse() would help you identify the type of each column. From there, you can edit any that are not what you wanted.\n\n\nQ: Where would be a good location to get some practice on most of the packages we will be using in this class?\nA: The labs and homeworks are one place. But, there are also exercises in the “textbook” for this class: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\n\n\nQ: How do we grasp Markdown easier?\nA: Trying things out and learning the basic rules. I would recommend starting with an RMarkdown document and just typing a sentence. Then knit to see what that looks like. Then, try to bold and italicize some text. Then try to add some headers. Then, add a bulleted list. Each time knitting to see the output. With that, you’ll have most of the markdown you’ll need! reference for basics\n\n\nQ: I am still not sure whether this class focuses more on the programming aspect or the mathematical concepts\nA: Both! First 5 weeks, more programming; Last 5: combination of both are used, but new programming concepts aren’t introduced a ton, so we focus on the stats while continuing to use what we learned the first five weeks!\n\n\nQ: Is there any rules for coercion?\nA: There are rules! Summarized here\n\n\nQ: When do we use R markdown?\nA: When completing labs, homework assignments, case studies, and likely on the final project. You can also take notes in RMarkdown, but that’s up to you!\n\n\nQ: Never heard about ggplot2. I think everyone had already heard of it previously…\nA: While some students have, you’re not alone! We’ll have two lectures on this and get plenty of practice soon!\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nLab 02 due Friday (1/20; 11:59 PM)\nHW01 due Monday (1/23; 11:59 PM)\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class\n\nNotes (1/19):\n\nLab01 Graded - see GitHub issue for comments; 2pts == full credit\n\nCommon issues:\n\nDid not knit file to HTML\nDid not include name in file\nYou do not need to version control the .RProj file\nYou should replace the “instruction” text with your explanations/interpretations\n\nIf you received a zero, you should have an email from me\n\nLab02 released\nHW01 released - let’s take a look\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\n\nphilosophy\npipes\ncommon operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges\n\n\n\nSource: dplyr.tidyverse.org"

    "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: what does |> mean?\nA: It means “and then” and is called a “pipe.” Discussing this in more detail in today’s lecture!\n\n\nQ: I think the lab is much more harder than the lecture.\nA: This first week there is a lot to learn regarding tooling, but once you’ve got that down the “process” of completing a lab will become second nature. Then, it’s just content…and applying something is always more difficult than listening to it being explained. So, labs will be a bit harder than lecture…but that’s by design b/c 1) we grade on effort (it’s ok to be wrong in labs!) and 2) answer keys will be posted (learning from mistakes/places we struggle is a great way to learn!)\n\n\nQ: Just curious about the oral presentation portion of the final project. Will this be a requirement in the form of a recorded video (like in COGS 108), or will we be presenting our project findings live in front of the class on the due date?\nA: There are going to be two options (most likely). A recording will definitely be an option. We’re also hoping to have an option where you can come present live, to the instructional staff and any students who want to learn from one another.\n\n\nQ: I am curious about the similarities and differences between both of Python and R!\nA: Very briefly, some similarities: both are object-oriented programming languages (although R is not only object-oriented); both are great for data analysis; differences: python arguably has a simpler syntax; R is, at its core, designed for statistical analysis so I’d argue it’s better for that; Python is a general-programming language so it’s arguablly better for software development; R has an implementation of the grammar of graphics, so I’d argue it’s better for data visualization (but some would disagree).\n\n\nQ: How can I understand dataframes in R easier?\nA: With practice! Today’s lecture, this week 2 lab, and your first hw will help you get additional practice. Then, we’ll use them throughout the course and build your understanding.\n\n\nQ: For very large data sets, how would you be able to find every type coercion?\nA: Each column would have a single type. glimpse() would help you identify the type of each column. From there, you can edit any that are not what you wanted.\n\n\nQ: Where would be a good location to get some practice on most of the packages we will be using in this class?\nA: The labs and homeworks are one place. But, there are also exercises in the “textbook” for this class: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\n\n\nQ: How do we grasp Markdown easier?\nA: Trying things out and learning the basic rules. I would recommend starting with an RMarkdown document and just typing a sentence. Then knit to see what that looks like. Then, try to bold and italicize some text. Then try to add some headers. Then, add a bulleted list. Each time knitting to see the output. With that, you’ll have most of the markdown you’ll need! reference for basics\n\n\nQ: I am still not sure whether this class focuses more on the programming aspect or the mathematical concepts\nA: Both! First 5 weeks, more programming; Last 5: combination of both are used, but new programming concepts aren’t introduced a ton, so we focus on the stats while continuing to use what we learned the first five weeks!\n\n\nQ: Is there any rules for coercion?\nA: There are rules! Summarized here\n\n\nQ: When do we use R markdown?\nA: When completing labs, homework assignments, case studies, and likely on the final project. You can also take notes in RMarkdown, but that’s up to you!\n\n\nQ: Never heard about ggplot2. I think everyone had already heard of it previously…\nA: While some students have, you’re not alone! We’ll have two lectures on this and get plenty of practice soon!"

Historically, factors were much easier to work with than character vectors, so many base R functions automatically convert character vectors to factors.\nfactors are still useful when you have true categorical data, and when you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display. The goal of the forcats package is to provide a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors.\n\n\n\nSource: forcats.tidyverse.org"

    "text": "APPLY NOW: Volunteer or Intern to fight plastic pollution or turn out the vote on campus!\nCALPIRG Students is a student organization on campus that works to protect the environment, address food insecurity, and promote civic engagement. We helped nearly 10,000 students register to vote in California and got the UCs to release new policy to phase out single-use plastics to protect our oceans! Get involved to protect our oceans!\n\nThis Winter, we’re working to protect our oceans. They give us food, provide most of the oxygen we breathe, and are home to awesome biodiversity like whales and sea turtles, but our oceans are at risk from things like overfishing, oil drilling, and pollution. That’s why we’re calling on Governor Newsom to increase protections for marine areas in California!\nWe’re also working on campaigns addressing hunger & homelessness, fighting plastic pollution, and promoting voter participation.\nAs a volunteer or intern with CALPIRG you can:\n\nBuild grassroots support\nWork with the media and help organize press conferences with experts and elected officials\nLobby elected officials\nPlan big events like rallies or a benefit concert\nLearn key nonprofit management and fundraising skills\n\nLearn skills, build your resume, and work with issues that matter. Apply today.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Curious about why we’re using RStudio on DataHub instead of running it locally. Are there tasks that require the hardware used in DataHub or can most of the tasks be also done on a laptop?\nA: You could run this whole class locally and are free to do so! The one place where you would run into issues is that I assume packages (which have been installed on datahub) are installed. So, you would just have to install those packages before proceeding.\n\n\nQ: How exactly do students make appointments for the Wednesday office hour? Is it simply through email or is there a separate form?\nA: I use Calendly for this. The link to sign up is on Canvas!\n\n\nQ: I am still not sure how to clone GitHub code into datahub.\nA: This will be covered in lab this week!\n\n\nQ: How will we submit the lab. What will the lab being release and when will it due?\nA: Labs, homework, and exams will all be “submitted” by pushing to GitHub (covered in lab on Friday). Once it’s on GitHub, it’s submitted! This weeks lab will be released today. Typically, each week’s lab will be released on Monday of the week it’s due.\n\n\nQ: Do we need to bring our own computer to lab?\nA: Good question! I should have covered this. Lab is in the same room as lecture, so you will need your own computer. If you don’t have one, please reach out to me or campus resources (listed in the syllabus) and I’ll see what I can do!\n\n\nQ: After class today, I am a little confused on how we will be writing code for assignments. Will we be doing everything through RStudio once we have opened DataHub, or will there be a cell format similar to Jupyter Notebooks when using Python? In other words, can we expect all of our assignments to be conducted in RStudio as we did today?\nA: The code you submit will typically be in R Markdown documents (discussing more today!) These are similar to Jupyter Notebooks. And yes, everything can be done in RStudio as demo-ed on Tuesday.\n\n\nQ: I know you mentioned R has changed since you last used it. Would it be possible for you to share any resources or materials that you and other R practitioners find useful. I.E. Frameworks/Conventions/Blogs. A: Ah, so I meant to say that R has changed since I first used it many years ago. I have continued to use and learn R since then! I’ve never stopped using R. That said, I have/know of TONS of resources. Two big compilations I can recommend are: learnr4free and the Big Book of R. If there’s something specific you’re interested, feel free to let me know and I can point to more specific resources!\n\n\nQ: I’m anxious to learn Github - have put it off for most of my programming life. It seems so complicated! :(\nA: It is complicated, but that’s b/c it’s doing something REALLY hard. That said, the basics are not too complicated. So this course will force you to learn the basics, and then you’ll be on your way to learn the harder stuff!\n\n\nQ: Could you talk about the prevalence of R in industry (use cases / types of jobs / etc.)? My general understanding of it is that it’s kind of out the door when compared to Python.\nA: Yes! I’ll try to discuss this more throughout the course, but R is super popular among data scientists, particularly those who have a focus in statistics, biological data (bioinformatics), econometrics, data analysis, and/or data journalism. If you’re trying to do data engineering, you likely won’t see/use R, but if you’re analyzing and visualizing data in your job, you’re likely to encounter R. That said, Python is certainly a more popular language. That’s why I/we teach it in our intro programming course!\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nLab 01 due tomorrow (Friday) 11:59 PM\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class (both Tu and today’s lectures available)\nStudent survey “due” Sunday (1/15) 11:59 PM\n\n\nUpdate: Lab will be podcast but restricted to UCSD students and will not be archived.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nOperators\nData in R\nRMarkdown"

    "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: Curious about why we’re using RStudio on DataHub instead of running it locally. Are there tasks that require the hardware used in DataHub or can most of the tasks be also done on a laptop?\nA: You could run this whole class locally and are free to do so! The one place where you would run into issues is that I assume packages (which have been installed on datahub) are installed. So, you would just have to install those packages before proceeding.\n\n\nQ: How exactly do students make appointments for the Wednesday office hour? Is it simply through email or is there a separate form?\nA: I use Calendly for this. The link to sign up is on Canvas!\n\n\nQ: I am still not sure how to clone GitHub code into datahub.\nA: This will be covered in lab this week!\n\n\nQ: How will we submit the lab. What will the lab being release and when will it due?\nA: Labs, homework, and exams will all be “submitted” by pushing to GitHub (covered in lab on Friday). Once it’s on GitHub, it’s submitted! This weeks lab will be released today. Typically, each week’s lab will be released on Monday of the week it’s due.\n\n\nQ: Do we need to bring our own computer to lab?\nA: Good question! I should have covered this. Lab is in the same room as lecture, so you will need your own computer. If you don’t have one, please reach out to me or campus resources (listed in the syllabus) and I’ll see what I can do!\n\n\nQ: After class today, I am a little confused on how we will be writing code for assignments. Will we be doing everything through RStudio once we have opened DataHub, or will there be a cell format similar to Jupyter Notebooks when using Python? In other words, can we expect all of our assignments to be conducted in RStudio as we did today?\nA: The code you submit will typically be in R Markdown documents (discussing more today!) These are similar to Jupyter Notebooks. And yes, everything can be done in RStudio as demo-ed on Tuesday.\n\n\nQ: I know you mentioned R has changed since you last used it. Would it be possible for you to share any resources or materials that you and other R practitioners find useful. I.E. Frameworks/Conventions/Blogs. A: Ah, so I meant to say that R has changed since I first used it many years ago. I have continued to use and learn R since then! I’ve never stopped using R. That said, I have/know of TONS of resources. Two big compilations I can recommend are: learnr4free and the Big Book of R. If there’s something specific you’re interested, feel free to let me know and I can point to more specific resources!\n\n\nQ: I’m anxious to learn Github - have put it off for most of my programming life. It seems so complicated! :(\nA: It is complicated, but that’s b/c it’s doing something REALLY hard. That said, the basics are not too complicated. So this course will force you to learn the basics, and then you’ll be on your way to learn the harder stuff!\n\n\nQ: Could you talk about the prevalence of R in industry (use cases / types of jobs / etc.)? My general understanding of it is that it’s kind of out the door when compared to Python.\nA: Yes! I’ll try to discuss this more throughout the course, but R is super popular among data scientists, particularly those who have a focus in statistics, biological data (bioinformatics), econometrics, data analysis, and/or data journalism. If you’re trying to do data engineering, you likely won’t see/use R, but if you’re analyzing and visualizing data in your job, you’re likely to encounter R. That said, Python is certainly a more popular language. That’s why I/we teach it in our intro programming course!"

To this end, through interaction with unique data sets and interesting questions, this course helps students 1) gain fluency in the R programming language, 2) effectively explore & visualize data, 3) use statistical thinking to analyze data and rigorously evaluate their conclusions, and 4) effectively communicate their results. Course objectives are accomplished through hands-on practice, using real-world data to learn via case studies, and project-based learning.\n\nDays & Times\n\n\n\n\n\n Lecture: Tu/Th 2-3:20 (Peterson Hall 104)\n Lab: Fri 1-1:50 (Peterson Hall 104)\n\nInstructional Staff & Office Hours\n\n\n\nInstructor\nShannon Ellis\nsellis@ucsd.edu\nWed 2-3\nVirtual (see canvas)\n\n\n\n\n\nTh 12:50-1:50 PM\nCSB 243\n\n\nTA\nShubham Kulkarni\n\nF 12-1PM\nCSB 114\n\n\nIAs\nChristian Kim\n\nTh 11AM-12PM\nCSB 114\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nProgram at the introductory level in the R statistical programming language\nEmploy the tidyverse suite of packages to interact with, wrangle, visualize, and model data\nExplain & apply statistical concepts (estimation, linear regression, logistic regression, etc.) for data analysis\nCommunicate data science projects through effective visualization, oral presentation, and written reports\n\n\n\nTexts\nTexts are freely available online:\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics\nÇetinkaya-Rundeland and Hardin\nOpenIntro, 1st Edition, 2021\n\n\nR for Data Science\nGrolemund and Wickham\nO’Reilly, 1st edition, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\nYou should have access to a laptop and bring it to every class, fully charged (as possible).\nNote: If you do not have consistent access to the technology needed, please use this form to request a loaner laptop.

    "text": "Class\nClass will include short lectures as well as interactive activities. The goal of lecture is to introduce the topics and information needed for the course. The goal of your time outside of lecture is to practice with topics that are introduced and deepen your understanding of material presented in class. Since so much of programming and statistical analysis is learned best by doing, we’ll prioritize that throughout the course, both in and outside of the classroom.\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\nMy goal is that every student, regardless of their background or perspective, will be well-served by this course. My philosophy is that the diversity of students in this class is a huge asset to our learning community; our differences provide opportunities for learning and understanding. I intend to present course materials that are conscious of and respectful to diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, politics, and culture); however, if I ever fall short or if you ever have suggestions for improvement, please do share with me! This feedback is always welcomed, and I am always in the process of learning and improving to this end. If you would like to provide that feedback anonymously, please use the anonymous Google Form.*\n\nWhat should you call me?\nMost students call me Professor/Prof Ellis, and that’s great! This is how I typically sign emails to students. I’m also totally OK with you addressing me as Shannon or Dr. Ellis.\n\n\nWhat I should call you?\nI should call you by your preferred name, with the correct pronunciation. Please correct me (in the moment or via email/Campuswire after the fact…however you’re most comfortable) if I ever make a mistake.\n\n\n\nDisability Access\nStudents requesting accommodations due to a disability should provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. If you are struggling to get necessary accommodations or want to further discuss your accommodations, please feel free to reach out to Professor Ellis directly.\nContacting the OSD can help you further:\n858.534.4382 (phone)\nosd@ucsd.edu (email)\nhttp://disabilities.ucsd.edu\n\n\nHow to get help\nIt’s great that we have so many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.\nThat said, to ensure that we’re respecting their time, TAs and IAs have been instructed they’re only encouraged to answer questions between standard working hours (M-F 9AM-5PM). Professor Ellis is also going to do her best to stick to these working hours and only go on Campuswire M-F each week. However, we know that’s not necessarily when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to post whenever is best for you while knowing that if you post late at night or on a weekend, you may not get a response until the next weekday. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question.\nIf you have:\n\nquestions about course content - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so post these to Campuswire!\na technical assignment question - come to office hours (or post to Campuswire). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished ‘in person’ where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. However, if that is not possible, post your question to Campuswire. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask. And, for those answering, help your classmates as much as you can without just giving the answer. Help guide them, point them in a direction, provide pseudo code, but do not provide code that answers assignment questions.\nbeen stuck on something for a while (>30min) and aren’t even really sure where to start - Programming can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn’t working. That’s OK - we’ve all been there! If you are stuck, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren’t exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30 minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, post on Campuswire). If you don’t have a specific question, include the information you have (what you’re stuck on, the code you’ve been trying that hasn’t been happening, and/or the error messages you’ve been getting).\nquestions about course logistics - first, check the course website. If you can’t find the answer there, first ask a classmate. If still unsure, post on Campuswire.\nquestions about a grade - Post on Campuswire with “regrades” tag in a private post to “Instructors & TAs”.\nsomething super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth - feel free to email Professor Ellis (sellis@ucsd.edu) or come to office hours. Please include COGS137 in the email subject line.\nsome feedback about the course you want to share anonymously - If you’ve been offended by an example in class, really liked or disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn’t but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the anonymous Google Form*\n\n*This form can be taken down at any time if it’s not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nDon’t cheat.\nYou are generally encouraged to work together and help one another in this course. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. A helpful heuristic can b to ask yourself “Can I explain each piece of code and each analysis carried out in what I’m submitting? Could I reproduce this code/analysis on my own?”; you should be able to answer “Yes” to both questions for everything you submit in this course. For labs and assignments, you are allowed and encouraged to work together, but it is your responsibility to ensure you understand everything you’ve submitted. (For exams, all work has to be completed individually and communication with others about the exam is not allowed; this will be discussed more explicitly before exams.)\nA note on sharing / reusing code: The Internet is an excellent resource; there will be many times you find helpful information online. You should use available resources (e.g. StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite any code you use directly or any code you use as inspiration. This can be done by including the URL/reference to the source directly in your code (as a code comment) or in accompanying text for a given assignment/exam/lab. You should never share code directly (e.g. copy + paste; share an send an answer to a classmate), but you can discuss code and work together on everything other than take-home exams.\nPlease review UCSD’s academic integrity policies here.\nCheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, Canvas or DataHub is down or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact Professor Ellis by emailing your assignment (sellis@ucsd.edu), or else it will be graded as late.\n\n\nCourse components\n\nLecture\nLectures will be your introduction to course topics and material. Lectures will be interactive, and you will be given time to practice with the lecture concepts during class. Attendance is not required, but is encouraged if you’re feeling well. To help incentivize coming to class, there will be a daily participation survey that will open at the end of lecture and close shortly after each Tues/Thurs lecture. Each time you fill out the lecture survey, you get a small % of credit toward your final project Completion of all surveys can provide up to 3.5% extra credit on your final project (not your final course grade).\n\nReadings\nReadings will be assigned for some class days and are best completed prior to the day’s lecture. These are meant to provide background and additional context for the upcoming day’s lecture topics. These can also be a good source after class when studying or reviewing topics discussed in class.\n\n\nPodcast\nIn case you miss class or would like to review the material covered in class, you can view the podcasts here.\n\n\n\nLabs (16%)\nLabs are meant to give you deeper understanding and hands-on experience with the technical and statistical topics introduced during lecture in a low-stakes environment. Lab sections will typically comprise of a short review and explanation of the lab and then time for you to complete the assigned weekly lab. Labs are submitted individually, but you are encouraged to work together during lab. You are free to ask and answer each others’ questions and discuss your work. Instructional staff will be present during lab to help further your understanding.\nLabs are graded for concerted effort. This is because when we learn something new, mistakes are going to happen! In fact, we learn a lot from the mistakes we make during the learning process. If your submission reflects ~50 min of work/effort, you will receive full credit for the week’s lab.\nLab attendance is not required, but is definitely encouraged if you are feeling well. While slides used are shared, lab sessions are not recorded, so being present is the best way to fully engage in the course.\n\n\nHomework (32%)\nAfter practice in lecture and labs, homework assignments are meant to demonstrate your solidified understanding of the course material. These are typically 2-4x longer and more involved than labs. Homework assignments are completed and submitted individually and are marked for correctness. You are allowed to work together on homework assignments, but academic integrity must be upheld.\n\n\nMidterm (15%)\nThere will be a single take-home exam due in week 4, and you will have at least 48 hours to complete it. This exam is meant to assess your understanding of the R programming language prior to us moving into focusing on case studies and full analyses. The exam will be completed individually and will be open-notes and open-Internet; however, you will not be permitted to ask questions of one another, the Internet, nor instructional staff while completing the take-home exam.\n\n\nTeams\nThere will be two case study mini-projects and a final project. Teams will be randomly assigned for the mini-projects but you will choose your final project groups. (By working with teammates throughout the course, you will also be able to use one another as a resource during labs and assignments.)\n\n\nCase Study Mini-projects (20%)\nStarting week 5, we will transition to a project-based course. This will allow us to use case studies to focus on deepening statistical knowledge and carrying out interesting analyses. In this, specific case studies and statistics topics will be discussed in class. In your teams and for each of the case studies, you will: 1) extend the analysis from class and 2) write up a full report of the case study for your team project.\n\n\nFinal Project (17%)\nThe final project will be completed in groups. There will be two different general final projects from which your group can choose, but the idea is that whichever you choose, you will be able to tackle it using and building upon the tools and techniques discussed in class. Briefly here, the two options will be: 1. Create a technical presentation on a statistics topic and/or an R package. 2. Carry out a data analysis.\nEach will require a written report and an oral presentation, but the specific requirements will differ between the two.\nFinal Projects will be due on Th 3/23 of finals week at 11:59 PM.\n\n\n\nGrading\nYour final grade will be comprised of the following:\n\n\n\nLabs (8)\n16%\n\n\nHomework (4)\n32%\n\n\nMidterm (1)\n16%\n\n\nCase Study Projects* (2)\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project(*) (1)\n17%\n\n\n\n* indicates group submission\n\nFinal Grades\nTo calculate final grades, I use the standard grading scale and do not round grades up (given the numerous extra credit opportunities offered):\n\n\n\n97-100%\nA+\n\n\n93-96%\nA\n\n\n90-92%\nA-\n\n\n87-89%\nB+\n\n\n83-86%\nB\n\n\n80-82%\nB-\n\n\n77-79%\nC+\n\n\n73-76%\nC\n\n\n70-72%\nC-\n\n\n67-69%\nD+\n\n\n63-66%\nD\n\n\n60-62%\nD-\n\n\n<60%\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate / missed work\nLate homework assignments and case study projects will be accepted up to 3 days (72 hours) after the assigned deadline. Late submissions will receive a 25% deduction.\nThere are no late deadlines for labs, the exam, or the final project.\nNote: Prof Ellis is a reasonable person; reach out to her if you have an extenuating circumstance at any point in the quarter.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nWe will work hard to grade everyone fairly and return assignments quickly. And, we know you also work hard and want you to receive the grade you’ve earned. Occasionally, grading mistakes do happen, and it’s important to us to correct them. If you think there is a mistake in your grade on an assignment, post privately on Campuswire to “Instructors” using the “regrades” tag within 72 hours. This post should include evidence of why you think your answer was correct and should point to the specific part of the assignment in question.\n\n\nProfessionalism\nPlease refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class. Not only is this distracting to you, but it can also be distracting to those around you. (Note that there is no consequence associated with this. I know it can be difficult, but I ask that you try your best!)"
