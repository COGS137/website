Just place any relevant R code in a code chunk, any relevant text outside of code chunks, and hit Knit HTML.\nSome define statistics as the field that focuses on turning information into knowledge. The first step in that process is to summarize and describe raw information - the data. In this lab we explore data on college majors and earnings, specifically the data behind the FiveThirtyEight story “The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major”.\nThese data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. While outside the scope of this lab, if you are curious about how raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared, see the code FiveThirtyEight authors used.\nWe should also note that there are many considerations that go into picking a major. Earnings potential and employment prospects are two of them, and they are important, but they don’t tell the whole story. Keep this in mind as you analyze the data."

By default arrange sorts in ascending order, which is what we want here – we’re interested in the major with the lowest unemployment rate.\n\ncollege_recent_grads |>\n  arrange(unemployment_rate)\n\nThis gives us what we wanted, but not in an ideal form. First, the name of the major barely fits on the page. Second, some of the variables are not that useful (e.g. major_code, major_category) and some we might want front and center are not easily viewed (e.g. unemployment_rate).\nWe can use the select function to choose which variables to display, and in which order:\nNote that your output here likely has a whole bunch of decimal places in the unemployment variable? You likely don’t want all those values to be displayed.\nThere are two ways we can address this problem. One would be to round the unemployment_rate variable in the dataset or we can change the number of digits displayed, without touching the input data.\nBelow are instructions for how you would do both of these:\n\nRound unemployment_rate: We create a new variable with the mutate function. In this case, we’re overwriting the existing unemployment_rate variable, by rounding it to 4 decimal places.For example, the call to mutate would be: mutate(unemployment_rate = round(unemployment_rate, digits = 4))\nChange displayed number of digits without touching data: We can add an option to our R Markdown document to change the displayed number of digits in the output. To do so, add a new chunk, and set:\n\n\noptions(digits = 2)\n\nNote that the digits in options is scientific digits, and in round they are decimal places. If you’re thinking “Wouldn’t it be nice if they were consistent?”, you’re right…\nYou don’t need to do both of these; that would be redundant. The next exercise asks you to choose one.\n\nExercise 1\nWhich of these options, changing the input data or altering the number of digits displayed without touching the input data, is the better option?

    "text": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n\n\nA percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: Wikipedia\nThere are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: p25th, median, and p75th. These correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.\n\nExercise 3\nWhy do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\nThe question we want to answer “How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?”. We need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by major_category. Then, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups. This decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions. So first, we need to visualize the data.\nWe use the ggplot function to do this. The first argument is the data frame, and the next argument gives the mapping of the variables of the data to the aesthetic elements of the plot.\nLet’s start simple and take a look at the distribution of all median incomes, without considering the major categories.\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nAlong with the plot, we get a message:\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\nThis is telling us that we might want to reconsider the binwidth we chose for our histogram – or more accurately, the binwidth we didn’t specify. It’s good practice to always think in the context of the data and try out a few binwidths before settling on a binwidth. You might ask yourself: “What would be a meaningful difference in median incomes?” $1 is obviously too little, $10000 might be too high.\n\n\nExercise 4\nTry binwidths of $1000 and $5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the geom_histogram function. So to specify a binwidth of $1000, you would use geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000).\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function. Note here that you can calculate multiple summary statistics within a single summarise call:\n\ncollege_recent_grads |>\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nBased on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.\nNext, we facet the plot by major category.\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap( ~ major_category, ncol = 4)\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in the earlier exercise.\nNow that we’ve seen the shapes of the distributions of median incomes for each major category, we should have a better idea for which summary statistic to use to quantify the typical median income.\n\n\nExercise 7\nWhich major category has the highest typical (you’ll need to decide what this means) median income? Also note that we are looking for the highest statistic, so make sure if you arrange to do so in the correct direction.\n\n\nExercise 8\nWhich major category is the least popular in this sample?"

This is helpful for finding the mean beauty score for each row. However in the remainder of the analysis we don’t want to, say, calculate summary statistics for each row, or fit a model for each row. Hence we need to undo the effect of rowwise, which we can do with ungroup."

In this and subsequent labs, there will be less code provided, and it will be up to you to write the requisite code.\nThe goal of this lab is to get you comfortable working with tidy datasets and using dplyr to do so.\n\n\nGetting started\nTo get started, accept the lab02 assignment (link on Canvas), clone the repo (using SSH) into RStudio on datahub. And, then you’re ready to go!\n\n\nPackages\nThe only package required for completion of this lab is tidyverse, as dplyr (which you’ll be using a lot in this lab) is one of the packages in the tidyverse. Be sure to import the tidyverse prior to completing the lab.\n\n\nData\nFor this lab, we’ll be using the storms dataset from the dplyr package, which includes data about a subset of storms from 1975. The description from this dataset states “This data is a subset of the NOAA Atlantic hurricane database best track data, https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat. The data includes the positions and attributes of 198 tropical storms, measured every six hours during the lifetime of a storm.”\nRemember that you can use ?storms to look up the documentation for the dataset. Be sure to read and understand what information is stored in each variable before proceeding. The instructions below are not very guided and will require that you have read and understood the information in the dataset first.\n\n\nExercises\nFor each of the following, write code using dplyr functions to determine the answers to each of the questions. Your responses should include the code, its output, and a few words that answer the question.\nNote that the final two questions are optional. Definitely give them a try, but it’s OK if you don’t have time to figure them out!\n\nExercise 1\nHow many unique hurricanes are included in this dataset?\n\n\nExercise 2\nWhich tropical storm affected the largest area experiencing tropical storm strength winds? And, what was the maximum sustained wind speed for that storm?\n\n\nExercise 3\nAmong all storms in this dataset, in which month are storms most common? Does this depend on the status of the storm? (In other words, are hurricanes more common in certain months than tropical depressions? or tropical storms?)\n\n\nExercise 4\nYour boss asks for the name, year, and status of all category 5 storms that have happened in the 2000s. Carry out the operations that would deliver what they’re looking for.\n\n\nExercise 5\nFilter these data to only include storms that occurred during your lifetime (your code and results may differ from your classmates!). Among storms that have occurred during your lifetime, what’s the mean and median air pressure across all measurements taken?\n\n\nExercise 6\n(optional challenge) Which decade (of the storms included in the dataset) had the largest number of unique reported storms?\n\n\nExercise 7\n(optional challenge) - Among the subset of storms occurring in your lifetime, which storm lasted the longest? Include your code and explain your answer.\nYay, you’re done! Knit your file, commit all remaining changes to your .Rmd and .html files, use the commit message “Done with Lab 2! 💪”, and push. Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo."

These steps will be demo-ed during lab and you’ll have time to walk through the steps!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you aren’t able to attend lab and get stuck here, there is a podcast recording from lecture on 9/29 from the COGS 137 Fa21 iteration where you can see these steps demo-ed.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Email and Username\nThe first step requires two pieces of information: your email address and your name.\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Terminal pane\nType the following two lines of code, replacing the information in the quotation marks with your info:\n\n\ngit config --global user.email \"your email\"\ngit config --global user.name \"your name\"\n\nFor example, for me these are:\n\ngit config --global user.email \"sellis@ucsd.edu\"\ngit config --global user.name \"Shannon Ellis\"\n\nTo confirm that the changes have been implemented, run the following:\n\ngit config --global user.email\ngit config --global user.name\n\n\n\nStep 2: Generate ssh key\nIn the terminal, you’ll want to generate an ssh key by typing:\n\nssh-keygen\n\nAfter hitting enter/return to execute the above, you’ll press return/enter three times to bypass specifying a location and passphrase.\n\n\nStep 3: Copy your ssh key\nFrom the terminal type:\n\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nYou’ll want to highlight and copy the full result of this command. It will start with ssh-rsa and end with dsmlp.login.ucsd.edu.\n\n\nStep 4: Let GitHub know your key\n\nIn your browser, navigate to https://github.com/settings/keys\nClick “New SSH Key”\nSet title to DSMLP\nPaste what you copied in step 3 into the “Key” box\nClick “Add SSH Key”\n\n\n\nStep 5: Finalize\nReturn to the terminal in RStudio and run the following command:\n\nssh git@github.com\n\nYou’ll then see a message like You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. At this point, you’re all set!\nThis will be the only time you have to do this. From here on out, you’ll be able to “communicate” with GitHub from RStudio without typing your username/password."

The different datasets are maked by the dataset variable.\nTo find out more about the dataset, type the following in your Console: ?datasaurus_dozen.

Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Rmd document and successfully knit it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data <- datasaurus_dozen |>\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |>, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: <-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points,m hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nIf this seems like a lot, it is. And you will learn about the philosophy of building data visualizations in layer in detail next week. For now, follow along with the code that is provided.\nFor the second part of this exercises, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear – it’s dinosaurial!\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let’s calculate correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\nStart with dino_data and calculate a summary statistic that we will call r as the correlation between x and y.\n\ndino_data |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    <dbl>\n1 -0.0645\n\n\nThis is a good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 2”, and push.\n\n\nExercise 3\nPlot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nThis is another good place to pause, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 3”, and push.\n\n\nExercise 4\nPlot y vs. x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\nYou should pause again, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 4”, and push.\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don’t add a legend.\n\n\nExercise 5\nFinally, let’s plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.\n\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients.\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |>\n  group_by(dataset) |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\nYou’re done with the data analysis exercises, but we’d like you to do two more things:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ?(caption)"

You may make a different decision than your classmate and could both be correct.\nAlso, note that the final two parts of this assignment will take you way longer than you think they will. Definitely do not wait until the last minute to start this assignment."

    "text": "Part II: Imitation is the highest form of flattery\nIn class we learned a handful of ways to customize visualizations. Now, it’s your turn to apply what you learned by recreating someone else’s visualization.\n\nQuestion 4\nFor this question, find a visualization somewhere on the Internet and recreate the visualization as close as you can using ggplot2. To make this easier on yourself, you’ll likely want to find a visualization where the data are readily available. (To get started, FiveThirtyEight makes a lot of the data from their articles available and has many charts in their articles. You are not required to recreate a visualization from FiveThirtyEight; however, if you’re not sure where to start, you have this option.) Your answer should include an image of the original visualization, a reference to the original image (this could simply be a URL), and your code + recreation.\nNotes: - To insert an image in an RMarkdown document, you can use the syntax ![alt text](path/to/image.png). - The R/ggplot2 code to create your visualization cannot already exist on the internet. (For example, choosing to recreate a plot from the R Graph Gallery would not be an option b/c all the code is already there and you wouldn’t learn as much.)\n\n\nQuestion 5\nBriefly explain what you learned about ggplot2 in the process of re-creating this visualization.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nExplain how your visualization differs from the original (It’s OK if yours is not a perfect recreation!)"

    "text": "Part III: Take a sad plot and make it better\n\nQuestion 7\nThis question was inspired by Alison Hill’s talk. The idea here is that there is a lot of data all around us and a whole bunch of visualizations. Some of them are really excellent, and some could be improved. Choose a visualization you’ve created in the past OR a visualization you’ve found out in the world that could benefit from a redesign and/or significant visual improvement. (This could be the same visualization you recreated above, but for most it will likely be a totally different visualization.) Your answer should include an image of the original visualization, a reference to the original image (this could simply be a URL), and your code + improved version.\nNote: If you’re unsure where to look for visualizations that would benefit from improvement, check out Flowing Data’s Ugly Charts or Reddit’s Data is ugly. You may need to recreate the dataset (meaning store the values from the visualization in a tibble) needed to generate the visualization prior to improving the design.\n\n\nQuestion 8\nBriefly explain what you learned about ggplot2 in the process of re-creating this visualization.\n\n\nQuestion 9\nExplain why you made the design and visualization choices you did for your improved version."

Show only the top 3 majors by adding head(3) at the end of the pipeline.\nThe sharewomen column lists the proportion of women in each major. So we can arrange our data in descending order using desc(sharewomen), then select the columns we want: major, total, and sharewomen.

    "text": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n\nExercise 3\nWhy do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\nThe mean is more affected by the presence of outliers and by the skew of the distribution. Thus, the presence of a single person with very high income can increase the mean substantively, such that it’s no longer a good impression of the overall distribution. In contrast, the median (or the “middle number”) tells us the income exactly in the middle of the distribution.\n\n\nExercise 4\nTry binwidths of $1000 and $5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the geom_histogram function. So to specify a binwidth of $1000, you would use geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000).\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5000)\n\n\n\n\nI ended up choosing binwidth=5000. When binwidth=1000, there were too many small differences in income that were thus not grouped together, and it was harder to see the overall shape of the distribution.\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function:\n\ncollege_recent_grads |>\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n    min    max   mean   med     sd    q1    q3\n  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 22000 110000 40151. 36000 11470. 33000 45000\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nBased on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.\nThe underlying distribution of median incomes is somewhat right-skewed, with at least 1-2 majors making a lot of money. Because of this, I’m going to use the median median income.\nIt would be probably be fine to use the mean median income as well—judging by the distribution of median incomes in each major_category, which are relatively normal-ish.\n\n\nExercise 6\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in the earlier exercise.\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ major_category, ncol = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nWhich major category has the highest typical (you’ll need to decide what this means) median income?

If you’re not sure where to start, the DatatoViz resource is a great place to help with ideas! If you’re still struggling, be sure when we get to case studies to really think to yourself for each plot, why did prof choose this plot? Could another have been better? And, discuss with your teammates (once you have those)!\n\n\nQ: maybe i missed it… but i am confused about the difference between “count” and “proportions”. Would they end up being the same thing? is the code different for doing count vs. proportion?\nA: Another student had this question, and it’s a good one! Count is for the value across the dataset. Proportions are calculated within the group, such that each group’s values are displayed out of 100%. Happy to discuss more if there are questions. We’ll see an example of this in today’s lecture!\n\n\nQ: Not the lecture, but the way to think in the way to get the “right” plot for the data.\nA: So, the good news is that there isn’t typically one right way. There’s room for personalization, personal preferences, and sometimes, there’s just more than one way! The bad news is that it takes time to learn best practices…but that’s part of what this class is all about!\n\n\nQ: Why is ChatGPT mentioned in the lab answers?\nA: Because I assume that some students are using this as a resource. And, that’s great! It’s there so that you get a sense of ChatGPT’s strengths (sometimes it really does give helpful dplyr code or get you started on the right path) and its weaknesses (it’s still important to think critically if you’re choosing to use it as a tool!) ChatGPT is by no means required in this course. In fact, I think labs/assignments may take longer if you are using it.

If you’re not sure where to start, the DatatoViz resource is a great place to help with ideas! If you’re still struggling, be sure when we get to case studies to really think to yourself for each plot, why did prof choose this plot? Could another have been better? And, discuss with your teammates (once you have those)!\n\n\nQ: maybe i missed it… but i am confused about the difference between “count” and “proportions”. Would they end up being the same thing? is the code different for doing count vs. proportion?\nA: Another student had this question, and it’s a good one! Count is for the value across the dataset. Proportions are calculated within the group, such that each group’s values are displayed out of 100%. Happy to discuss more if there are questions. We’ll see an example of this in today’s lecture!\n\n\nQ: Not the lecture, but the way to think in the way to get the “right” plot for the data.\nA: So, the good news is that there isn’t typically one right way. There’s room for personalization, personal preferences, and sometimes, there’s just more than one way! The bad news is that it takes time to learn best practices…but that’s part of what this class is all about!\n\n\nQ: Why is ChatGPT mentioned in the lab answers?\nA: Because I assume that some students are using this as a resource. And, that’s great! It’s there so that you get a sense of ChatGPT’s strengths (sometimes it really does give helpful dplyr code or get you started on the right path) and its weaknesses (it’s still important to think critically if you’re choosing to use it as a tool!) ChatGPT is by no means required in this course. In fact, I think labs/assignments may take longer if you are using it. I don’t have a sense yet who would learn the material better!"

When you want to use a single variable to facet your data and want to specify how many columns/rows to display, wrap!\n\n\nQ: When programming in R so far, I often find myself stuck at getting going on a problem and have a different time identifying on where to start. Any tips/advice on how to get past this initial bump in order to start getting through the problem?\nA: This is a common struggle! This may sound like an old-person response, but jotting down what you have and what you want (like on actual paper/iPad) can be really helpful. For example, if you have 3 columns and you know you want to have 3 columns at the end, but you want fewer rows, you can draw a picture of this and help yourself realize you need a filter. Of course when there are multiple steps, the drawings become a bit more complex…but also more helpful! The same can be said for data visualization. Drawing out quickly what you want can help you get started.\n\n\nQ:In what time frame will the lecture survey be available, how many hours after class will the survey be closed\nA: It will be open for at least 2h.\n\n\nQ:For HW1 Q7, I used read_csv and got an error message. I tried read.csv and it worked. Is there any difference between read_csv and read.csv?\nA: Hmm…I’d love to take a look to see what error you got. They are similar and often behave the same way. The difference is read.csv() was made before the tidyverse, so it reads your data in as a dataframe. read_csv() is a function that “plays nicely” with the tidyverse and reads the data in as a tibble/data frame. What does that mean practically? It means that typically each one will read the data in and you’ll get the same number of rows and columns. What could differ would be the column names and/or the column types (depending upon the data). All that said, read_csv() is what I’ll recommend in this course…so that’s why I’m curious about the error you got!\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nLab 03 due Friday (1/27; 11:59 PM)\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class\n\nCourse Announcements:\n\nLab02 Grades (Canvas) & Feedback (GitHub Issue) Posted\nHW02 Now Available\nDiscord? - Campuswire post\n“Vote” on posts when grades released (pink: send message; green: announce in class)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Angela Zoss and Eric Monson, Duke DVS"

When you want to use a single variable to facet your data and want to specify how many columns/rows to display, wrap!\n\n\nQ: When programming in R so far, I often find myself stuck at getting going on a problem and have a different time identifying on where to start. Any tips/advice on how to get past this initial bump in order to start getting through the problem?\nA: This is a common struggle! This may sound like an old-person response, but jotting down what you have and what you want (like on actual paper/iPad) can be really helpful. For example, if you have 3 columns and you know you want to have 3 columns at the end, but you want fewer rows, you can draw a picture of this and help yourself realize you need a filter. Of course when there are multiple steps, the drawings become a bit more complex…but also more helpful! The same can be said for data visualization. Drawing out quickly what you want can help you get started.\n\n\nQ:In what time frame will the lecture survey be available, how many hours after class will the survey be closed\nA: It will be open for at least 2h.\n\n\nQ:For HW1 Q7, I used read_csv and got an error message. I tried read.csv and it worked. Is there any difference between read_csv and read.csv?\nA: Hmm…I’d love to take a look to see what error you got. They are similar and often behave the same way. The difference is read.csv() was made before the tidyverse, so it reads your data in as a dataframe. read_csv() is a function that “plays nicely” with the tidyverse and reads the data in as a tibble/data frame. What does that mean practically? It means that typically each one will read the data in and you’ll get the same number of rows and columns. What could differ would be the column names and/or the column types (depending upon the data). All that said, read_csv() is what I’ll recommend in this course…so that’s why I’m curious about the error you got!"

    "text": "Q: what does |> mean?\nA: It means “and then” and is called a “pipe.” Discussing this in more detail in today’s lecture!\n\n\nQ: I think the lab is much more harder than the lecture.\nA: This first week there is a lot to learn regarding tooling, but once you’ve got that down the “process” of completing a lab will become second nature. Then, it’s just content…and applying something is always more difficult than listening to it being explained. So, labs will be a bit harder than lecture…but that’s by design b/c 1) we grade on effort (it’s ok to be wrong in labs!) and 2) answer keys will be posted (learning from mistakes/places we struggle is a great way to learn!)\n\n\nQ: Just curious about the oral presentation portion of the final project. Will this be a requirement in the form of a recorded video (like in COGS 108), or will we be presenting our project findings live in front of the class on the due date?\nA: There are going to be two options (most likely). A recording will definitely be an option. We’re also hoping to have an option where you can come present live, to the instructional staff and any students who want to learn from one another.\n\n\nQ: I am curious about the similarities and differences between both of Python and R!\nA: Very briefly, some similarities: both are object-oriented programming languages (although R is not only object-oriented); both are great for data analysis; differences: python arguably has a simpler syntax; R is, at its core, designed for statistical analysis so I’d argue it’s better for that; Python is a general-programming language so it’s arguablly better for software development; R has an implementation of the grammar of graphics, so I’d argue it’s better for data visualization (but some would disagree).\n\n\nQ: How can I understand dataframes in R easier?\nA: With practice! Today’s lecture, this week 2 lab, and your first hw will help you get additional practice. Then, we’ll use them throughout the course and build your understanding.\n\n\nQ: For very large data sets, how would you be able to find every type coercion?\nA: Each column would have a single type. glimpse() would help you identify the type of each column. From there, you can edit any that are not what you wanted.\n\n\nQ: Where would be a good location to get some practice on most of the packages we will be using in this class?\nA: The labs and homeworks are one place. But, there are also exercises in the “textbook” for this class: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\n\n\nQ: How do we grasp Markdown easier?\nA: Trying things out and learning the basic rules. I would recommend starting with an RMarkdown document and just typing a sentence. Then knit to see what that looks like. Then, try to bold and italicize some text. Then try to add some headers. Then, add a bulleted list. Each time knitting to see the output. With that, you’ll have most of the markdown you’ll need! reference for basics\n\n\nQ: I am still not sure whether this class focuses more on the programming aspect or the mathematical concepts\nA: Both! First 5 weeks, more programming; Last 5: combination of both are used, but new programming concepts aren’t introduced a ton, so we focus on the stats while continuing to use what we learned the first five weeks!\n\n\nQ: Is there any rules for coercion?\nA: There are rules! Summarized here\n\n\nQ: When do we use R markdown?\nA: When completing labs, homework assignments, case studies, and likely on the final project. You can also take notes in RMarkdown, but that’s up to you!\n\n\nQ: Never heard about ggplot2. I think everyone had already heard of it previously…\nA: While some students have, you’re not alone! We’ll have two lectures on this and get plenty of practice soon!\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nLab 02 due Friday (1/20; 11:59 PM)\nHW01 due Monday (1/23; 11:59 PM)\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class\n\nNotes (1/19):\n\nLab01 Graded - see GitHub issue for comments; 2pts == full credit\n\nCommon issues:\n\nDid not knit file to HTML\nDid not include name in file\nYou do not need to version control the .RProj file\nYou should replace the “instruction” text with your explanations/interpretations\n\nIf you received a zero, you should have an email from me\n\nLab02 released\nHW01 released - let’s take a look\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\n\nphilosophy\npipes\ncommon operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges\n\n\n\nSource: dplyr.tidyverse.org"

    "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: what does |> mean?\nA: It means “and then” and is called a “pipe.” Discussing this in more detail in today’s lecture!\n\n\nQ: I think the lab is much more harder than the lecture.\nA: This first week there is a lot to learn regarding tooling, but once you’ve got that down the “process” of completing a lab will become second nature. Then, it’s just content…and applying something is always more difficult than listening to it being explained. So, labs will be a bit harder than lecture…but that’s by design b/c 1) we grade on effort (it’s ok to be wrong in labs!) and 2) answer keys will be posted (learning from mistakes/places we struggle is a great way to learn!)\n\n\nQ: Just curious about the oral presentation portion of the final project. Will this be a requirement in the form of a recorded video (like in COGS 108), or will we be presenting our project findings live in front of the class on the due date?\nA: There are going to be two options (most likely). A recording will definitely be an option. We’re also hoping to have an option where you can come present live, to the instructional staff and any students who want to learn from one another.\n\n\nQ: I am curious about the similarities and differences between both of Python and R!\nA: Very briefly, some similarities: both are object-oriented programming languages (although R is not only object-oriented); both are great for data analysis; differences: python arguably has a simpler syntax; R is, at its core, designed for statistical analysis so I’d argue it’s better for that; Python is a general-programming language so it’s arguablly better for software development; R has an implementation of the grammar of graphics, so I’d argue it’s better for data visualization (but some would disagree).\n\n\nQ: How can I understand dataframes in R easier?\nA: With practice! Today’s lecture, this week 2 lab, and your first hw will help you get additional practice. Then, we’ll use them throughout the course and build your understanding.\n\n\nQ: For very large data sets, how would you be able to find every type coercion?\nA: Each column would have a single type. glimpse() would help you identify the type of each column. From there, you can edit any that are not what you wanted.\n\n\nQ: Where would be a good location to get some practice on most of the packages we will be using in this class?\nA: The labs and homeworks are one place. But, there are also exercises in the “textbook” for this class: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\n\n\nQ: How do we grasp Markdown easier?\nA: Trying things out and learning the basic rules. I would recommend starting with an RMarkdown document and just typing a sentence. Then knit to see what that looks like. Then, try to bold and italicize some text. Then try to add some headers. Then, add a bulleted list. Each time knitting to see the output. With that, you’ll have most of the markdown you’ll need! reference for basics\n\n\nQ: I am still not sure whether this class focuses more on the programming aspect or the mathematical concepts\nA: Both! First 5 weeks, more programming; Last 5: combination of both are used, but new programming concepts aren’t introduced a ton, so we focus on the stats while continuing to use what we learned the first five weeks!\n\n\nQ: Is there any rules for coercion?\nA: There are rules! Summarized here\n\n\nQ: When do we use R markdown?\nA: When completing labs, homework assignments, case studies, and likely on the final project. You can also take notes in RMarkdown, but that’s up to you!\n\n\nQ: Never heard about ggplot2. I think everyone had already heard of it previously…\nA: While some students have, you’re not alone! We’ll have two lectures on this and get plenty of practice soon!"

Historically, factors were much easier to work with than character vectors, so many base R functions automatically convert character vectors to factors.\nfactors are still useful when you have true categorical data, and when you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display. The goal of the forcats package is to provide a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors.\n\n\n\nSource: forcats.tidyverse.org"

    "text": "APPLY NOW: Volunteer or Intern to fight plastic pollution or turn out the vote on campus!\nCALPIRG Students is a student organization on campus that works to protect the environment, address food insecurity, and promote civic engagement. We helped nearly 10,000 students register to vote in California and got the UCs to release new policy to phase out single-use plastics to protect our oceans! Get involved to protect our oceans!\n\nThis Winter, we’re working to protect our oceans. They give us food, provide most of the oxygen we breathe, and are home to awesome biodiversity like whales and sea turtles, but our oceans are at risk from things like overfishing, oil drilling, and pollution. That’s why we’re calling on Governor Newsom to increase protections for marine areas in California!\nWe’re also working on campaigns addressing hunger & homelessness, fighting plastic pollution, and promoting voter participation.\nAs a volunteer or intern with CALPIRG you can:\n\nBuild grassroots support\nWork with the media and help organize press conferences with experts and elected officials\nLobby elected officials\nPlan big events like rallies or a benefit concert\nLearn key nonprofit management and fundraising skills\n\nLearn skills, build your resume, and work with issues that matter. Apply today.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Curious about why we’re using RStudio on DataHub instead of running it locally. Are there tasks that require the hardware used in DataHub or can most of the tasks be also done on a laptop?\nA: You could run this whole class locally and are free to do so! The one place where you would run into issues is that I assume packages (which have been installed on datahub) are installed. So, you would just have to install those packages before proceeding.\n\n\nQ: How exactly do students make appointments for the Wednesday office hour? Is it simply through email or is there a separate form?\nA: I use Calendly for this. The link to sign up is on Canvas!\n\n\nQ: I am still not sure how to clone GitHub code into datahub.\nA: This will be covered in lab this week!\n\n\nQ: How will we submit the lab. What will the lab being release and when will it due?\nA: Labs, homework, and exams will all be “submitted” by pushing to GitHub (covered in lab on Friday). Once it’s on GitHub, it’s submitted! This weeks lab will be released today. Typically, each week’s lab will be released on Monday of the week it’s due.\n\n\nQ: Do we need to bring our own computer to lab?\nA: Good question! I should have covered this. Lab is in the same room as lecture, so you will need your own computer. If you don’t have one, please reach out to me or campus resources (listed in the syllabus) and I’ll see what I can do!\n\n\nQ: After class today, I am a little confused on how we will be writing code for assignments. Will we be doing everything through RStudio once we have opened DataHub, or will there be a cell format similar to Jupyter Notebooks when using Python? In other words, can we expect all of our assignments to be conducted in RStudio as we did today?\nA: The code you submit will typically be in R Markdown documents (discussing more today!) These are similar to Jupyter Notebooks. And yes, everything can be done in RStudio as demo-ed on Tuesday.\n\n\nQ: I know you mentioned R has changed since you last used it. Would it be possible for you to share any resources or materials that you and other R practitioners find useful. I.E. Frameworks/Conventions/Blogs. A: Ah, so I meant to say that R has changed since I first used it many years ago. I have continued to use and learn R since then! I’ve never stopped using R. That said, I have/know of TONS of resources. Two big compilations I can recommend are: learnr4free and the Big Book of R. If there’s something specific you’re interested, feel free to let me know and I can point to more specific resources!\n\n\nQ: I’m anxious to learn Github - have put it off for most of my programming life. It seems so complicated! :(\nA: It is complicated, but that’s b/c it’s doing something REALLY hard. That said, the basics are not too complicated. So this course will force you to learn the basics, and then you’ll be on your way to learn the harder stuff!\n\n\nQ: Could you talk about the prevalence of R in industry (use cases / types of jobs / etc.)? My general understanding of it is that it’s kind of out the door when compared to Python.\nA: Yes! I’ll try to discuss this more throughout the course, but R is super popular among data scientists, particularly those who have a focus in statistics, biological data (bioinformatics), econometrics, data analysis, and/or data journalism. If you’re trying to do data engineering, you likely won’t see/use R, but if you’re analyzing and visualizing data in your job, you’re likely to encounter R. That said, Python is certainly a more popular language. That’s why I/we teach it in our intro programming course!\n\n\n\n\nDue Dates:\n\nLab 01 due tomorrow (Friday) 11:59 PM\nLecture Participation survey “due” after class (both Tu and today’s lectures available)\nStudent survey “due” Sunday (1/15) 11:59 PM\n\n\nUpdate: Lab will be podcast but restricted to UCSD students and will not be archived.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nOperators\nData in R\nRMarkdown"

    "text": "Q&A\n\nQ: Curious about why we’re using RStudio on DataHub instead of running it locally. Are there tasks that require the hardware used in DataHub or can most of the tasks be also done on a laptop?\nA: You could run this whole class locally and are free to do so! The one place where you would run into issues is that I assume packages (which have been installed on datahub) are installed. So, you would just have to install those packages before proceeding.\n\n\nQ: How exactly do students make appointments for the Wednesday office hour? Is it simply through email or is there a separate form?\nA: I use Calendly for this. The link to sign up is on Canvas!\n\n\nQ: I am still not sure how to clone GitHub code into datahub.\nA: This will be covered in lab this week!\n\n\nQ: How will we submit the lab. What will the lab being release and when will it due?\nA: Labs, homework, and exams will all be “submitted” by pushing to GitHub (covered in lab on Friday). Once it’s on GitHub, it’s submitted! This weeks lab will be released today. Typically, each week’s lab will be released on Monday of the week it’s due.\n\n\nQ: Do we need to bring our own computer to lab?\nA: Good question! I should have covered this. Lab is in the same room as lecture, so you will need your own computer. If you don’t have one, please reach out to me or campus resources (listed in the syllabus) and I’ll see what I can do!\n\n\nQ: After class today, I am a little confused on how we will be writing code for assignments. Will we be doing everything through RStudio once we have opened DataHub, or will there be a cell format similar to Jupyter Notebooks when using Python? In other words, can we expect all of our assignments to be conducted in RStudio as we did today?\nA: The code you submit will typically be in R Markdown documents (discussing more today!) These are similar to Jupyter Notebooks. And yes, everything can be done in RStudio as demo-ed on Tuesday.\n\n\nQ: I know you mentioned R has changed since you last used it. Would it be possible for you to share any resources or materials that you and other R practitioners find useful. I.E. Frameworks/Conventions/Blogs. A: Ah, so I meant to say that R has changed since I first used it many years ago. I have continued to use and learn R since then! I’ve never stopped using R. That said, I have/know of TONS of resources. Two big compilations I can recommend are: learnr4free and the Big Book of R. If there’s something specific you’re interested, feel free to let me know and I can point to more specific resources!\n\n\nQ: I’m anxious to learn Github - have put it off for most of my programming life. It seems so complicated! :(\nA: It is complicated, but that’s b/c it’s doing something REALLY hard. That said, the basics are not too complicated. So this course will force you to learn the basics, and then you’ll be on your way to learn the harder stuff!\n\n\nQ: Could you talk about the prevalence of R in industry (use cases / types of jobs / etc.)? My general understanding of it is that it’s kind of out the door when compared to Python.\nA: Yes! I’ll try to discuss this more throughout the course, but R is super popular among data scientists, particularly those who have a focus in statistics, biological data (bioinformatics), econometrics, data analysis, and/or data journalism. If you’re trying to do data engineering, you likely won’t see/use R, but if you’re analyzing and visualizing data in your job, you’re likely to encounter R. That said, Python is certainly a more popular language. That’s why I/we teach it in our intro programming course!"

Let’s do that today.\n\n\nQ: Does left_join(a, b) = right_join(b, a)?\nA: No. The total information would be equivalent but the order of columns would differ. In the left join, the columns from a would be first and in the right join, the colums from b would be listed first. But the actual rows that are joined/included would be the same.\n\n\nQ: I would still like to know if there is a way to save data sets more often when using functions on them, such as filter. I see we only saved data sets when we use functions like mutate, but why not other functions?\nA: You’re allowed to store variables into a new data frame whenever you’d like! Now, the more variables you create, the more to keep track of, so I would encourage you to store your output any time you make a “substantial” change to your data. So, say you do a filter, selection, and mutate to get your data into the format for analysis. I wouldn’t store after each step, but I would store it after I wrote the pipe doing all three. Follow up if this doesn’t clarify!\n\n\nQ: I think the left_join, right_join, and full_join was pretty confusing.\nA: You’re right! It is confusing.

Let’s do that today.\n\n\nQ: Does left_join(a, b) = right_join(b, a)?\nA: No. The total information would be equivalent but the order of columns would differ. In the left join, the columns from a would be first and in the right join, the colums from b would be listed first. But the actual rows that are joined/included would be the same.\n\n\nQ: I would still like to know if there is a way to save data sets more often when using functions on them, such as filter. I see we only saved data sets when we use functions like mutate, but why not other functions?\nA: You’re allowed to store variables into a new data frame whenever you’d like! Now, the more variables you create, the more to keep track of, so I would encourage you to store your output any time you make a “substantial” change to your data. So, say you do a filter, selection, and mutate to get your data into the format for analysis. I wouldn’t store after each step, but I would store it after I wrote the pipe doing all three. Follow up if this doesn’t clarify!\n\n\nQ: I think the left_join, right_join, and full_join was pretty confusing.\nA: You’re right! It is confusing. We’ll go through more examples and get more practice!"

This course website was adapted from her course website. These course slides/labs/homework…also adapted from Mine’s course and the related datascienceinabox. I am so *very* indebted to Mine! I also want to thank the Open Case Studies team for their tireless work in putting together interesting and topical case studies, a handful of which we use throughout the course. And, finally, thanks to Allison Horst, whose artwork is inspiring, educational, and fun…and is used throughout this course. Further, thanks to the R (education) community generally; planning this course was really fun because I had so many awesome resources to choose from. Having these materials made course prep and planning is just another example of what sets the R community apart!"

    "text": "Class\nClass will include short lectures as well as interactive activities. The goal of lecture is to introduce the topics and information needed for the course. The goal of your time outside of lecture is to practice with topics that are introduced and deepen your understanding of material presented in class. Since so much of programming and statistical analysis is learned best by doing, we’ll prioritize that throughout the course, both in and outside of the classroom.\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\nMy goal is that every student, regardless of their background or perspective, will be well-served by this course. My philosophy is that the diversity of students in this class is a huge asset to our learning community; our differences provide opportunities for learning and understanding. I intend to present course materials that are conscious of and respectful to diversity (gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, politics, and culture); however, if I ever fall short or if you ever have suggestions for improvement, please do share with me! This feedback is always welcomed, and I am always in the process of learning and improving to this end. If you would like to provide that feedback anonymously, please use the anonymous Google Form.*\n\nWhat should you call me?\nMost students call me Professor/Prof Ellis, and that’s great! This is how I typically sign emails to students. I’m also totally OK with you addressing me as Shannon or Dr. Ellis.\n\n\nWhat I should call you?\nI should call you by your preferred name, with the correct pronunciation. Please correct me (in the moment or via email/Campuswire after the fact…however you’re most comfortable) if I ever make a mistake.\n\n\n\nDisability Access\nStudents requesting accommodations due to a disability should provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. If you are struggling to get necessary accommodations or want to further discuss your accommodations, please feel free to reach out to Professor Ellis directly.\nContacting the OSD can help you further:\n858.534.4382 (phone)\nosd@ucsd.edu (email)\nhttp://disabilities.ucsd.edu\n\n\nHow to get help\nIt’s great that we have so many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.\nThat said, to ensure that we’re respecting their time, TAs and IAs have been instructed they’re only encouraged to answer questions between standard working hours (M-F 9AM-5PM). Professor Ellis is also going to do her best to stick to these working hours and only go on Campuswire M-F each week. However, we know that’s not necessarily when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to post whenever is best for you while knowing that if you post late at night or on a weekend, you may not get a response until the next weekday. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question.\nIf you have:\n\nquestions about course content - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so post these to Campuswire!\na technical assignment question - come to office hours (or post to Campuswire). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished ‘in person’ where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. However, if that is not possible, post your question to Campuswire. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask. And, for those answering, help your classmates as much as you can without just giving the answer. Help guide them, point them in a direction, provide pseudo code, but do not provide code that answers assignment questions.\nbeen stuck on something for a while (>30min) and aren’t even really sure where to start - Programming can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn’t working. That’s OK - we’ve all been there! If you are stuck, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren’t exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30 minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, post on Campuswire). If you don’t have a specific question, include the information you have (what you’re stuck on, the code you’ve been trying that hasn’t been happening, and/or the error messages you’ve been getting).\nquestions about course logistics - first, check the course website. If you can’t find the answer there, first ask a classmate. If still unsure, post on Campuswire.\nquestions about a grade - Post on Campuswire with “regrades” tag in a private post to “Instructors & TAs”.\nsomething super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth - feel free to email Professor Ellis (sellis@ucsd.edu) or come to office hours. Please include COGS137 in the email subject line.\nsome feedback about the course you want to share anonymously - If you’ve been offended by an example in class, really liked or disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn’t but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the anonymous Google Form*\n\n*This form can be taken down at any time if it’s not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nDon’t cheat.\nYou are generally encouraged to work together and help one another in this course. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. A helpful heuristic can b to ask yourself “Can I explain each piece of code and each analysis carried out in what I’m submitting? Could I reproduce this code/analysis on my own?”; you should be able to answer “Yes” to both questions for everything you submit in this course. For labs and assignments, you are allowed and encouraged to work together, but it is your responsibility to ensure you understand everything you’ve submitted. (For exams, all work has to be completed individually and communication with others about the exam is not allowed; this will be discussed more explicitly before exams.)\nA note on sharing / reusing code: The Internet is an excellent resource; there will be many times you find helpful information online. You should use available resources (e.g. StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite any code you use directly or any code you use as inspiration. This can be done by including the URL/reference to the source directly in your code (as a code comment) or in accompanying text for a given assignment/exam/lab. You should never share code directly (e.g. copy + paste; share an send an answer to a classmate), but you can discuss code and work together on everything other than take-home exams.\nPlease review UCSD’s academic integrity policies here.\nCheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, Canvas or DataHub is down or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact Professor Ellis by emailing your assignment (sellis@ucsd.edu), or else it will be graded as late.\n\n\nCourse components\n\nLecture\nLectures will be your introduction to course topics and material. Lectures will be interactive, and you will be given time to practice with the lecture concepts during class. Attendance is not required, but is encouraged if you’re feeling well. To help incentivize coming to class, there will be a daily participation survey that will open at the end of lecture and close shortly after each Tues/Thurs lecture. Each time you fill out the lecture survey, you get a small % of credit toward your final project Completion of all surveys can provide up to 3.5% extra credit on your final project (not your final course grade).\n\nReadings\nReadings will be assigned for some class days and are best completed prior to the day’s lecture. These are meant to provide background and additional context for the upcoming day’s lecture topics. These can also be a good source after class when studying or reviewing topics discussed in class.\n\n\nPodcast\nIn case you miss class or would like to review the material covered in class, you can view the podcasts here.\n\n\n\nLabs (16%)\nLabs are meant to give you deeper understanding and hands-on experience with the technical and statistical topics introduced during lecture in a low-stakes environment. Lab sections will typically comprise of a short review and explanation of the lab and then time for you to complete the assigned weekly lab. Labs are submitted individually, but you are encouraged to work together during lab. You are free to ask and answer each others’ questions and discuss your work. Instructional staff will be present during lab to help further your understanding.\nLabs are graded for concerted effort. This is because when we learn something new, mistakes are going to happen! In fact, we learn a lot from the mistakes we make during the learning process. If your submission reflects ~50 min of work/effort, you will receive full credit for the week’s lab.\nLab attendance is not required, but is definitely encouraged if you are feeling well. While slides used are shared, lab sessions are not recorded, so being present is the best way to fully engage in the course.\n\n\nHomework (32%)\nAfter practice in lecture and labs, homework assignments are meant to demonstrate your solidified understanding of the course material. These are typically 2-4x longer and more involved than labs. Homework assignments are completed and submitted individually and are marked for correctness. You are allowed to work together on homework assignments, but academic integrity must be upheld.\n\n\nMidterm (15%)\nThere will be a single take-home exam due in week 4, and you will have at least 48 hours to complete it. This exam is meant to assess your understanding of the R programming language prior to us moving into focusing on case studies and full analyses. The exam will be completed individually and will be open-notes and open-Internet; however, you will not be permitted to ask questions of one another, the Internet, nor instructional staff while completing the take-home exam.\n\n\nTeams\nThere will be two case study mini-projects and a final project. Teams will be randomly assigned for the mini-projects but you will choose your final project groups. (By working with teammates throughout the course, you will also be able to use one another as a resource during labs and assignments.)\n\n\nCase Study Mini-projects (20%)\nStarting week 5, we will transition to a project-based course. This will allow us to use case studies to focus on deepening statistical knowledge and carrying out interesting analyses. In this, specific case studies and statistics topics will be discussed in class. In your teams and for each of the case studies, you will: 1) extend the analysis from class and 2) write up a full report of the case study for your team project.\n\n\nFinal Project (17%)\nThe final project will be completed in groups. There will be two different general final projects from which your group can choose, but the idea is that whichever you choose, you will be able to tackle it using and building upon the tools and techniques discussed in class. Briefly here, the two options will be: 1. Create a technical presentation on a statistics topic and/or an R package. 2. Carry out a data analysis.\nEach will require a written report and an oral presentation, but the specific requirements will differ between the two.\nFinal Projects will be due on Th 3/23 of finals week at 11:59 PM.\n\n\n\nGrading\nYour final grade will be comprised of the following:\n\n\n\nLabs (8)\n16%\n\n\nHomework (4)\n32%\n\n\nMidterm (1)\n16%\n\n\nCase Study Projects* (2)\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project(*) (1)\n17%\n\n\n\n* indicates group submission\n\nFinal Grades\nTo calculate final grades, I use the standard grading scale and do not round grades up (given the numerous extra credit opportunities offered):\n\n\n\n97-100%\nA+\n\n\n93-96%\nA\n\n\n90-92%\nA-\n\n\n87-89%\nB+\n\n\n83-86%\nB\n\n\n80-82%\nB-\n\n\n77-79%\nC+\n\n\n73-76%\nC\n\n\n70-72%\nC-\n\n\n67-69%\nD+\n\n\n63-66%\nD\n\n\n60-62%\nD-\n\n\n<60%\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate / missed work\nLate homework assignments and case study projects will be accepted up to 3 days (72 hours) after the assigned deadline. Late submissions will receive a 25% deduction.\nThere are no late deadlines for labs, the exam, or the final project.\nNote: Prof Ellis is a reasonable person; reach out to her if you have an extenuating circumstance at any point in the quarter.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nWe will work hard to grade everyone fairly and return assignments quickly. And, we know you also work hard and want you to receive the grade you’ve earned. Occasionally, grading mistakes do happen, and it’s important to us to correct them. If you think there is a mistake in your grade on an assignment, post privately on Campuswire to “Instructors” using the “regrades” tag within 72 hours. This post should include evidence of why you think your answer was correct and should point to the specific part of the assignment in question.\n\n\nProfessionalism\nPlease refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class. Not only is this distracting to you, but it can also be distracting to those around you. (Note that there is no consequence associated with this. I know it can be difficult, but I ask that you try your best!)"
