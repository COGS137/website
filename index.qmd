### Course Info

Practical Data Science in R focuses on teaching students how to think rigorously throughout the data science process. To this end, through interaction with unique data sets and interesting questions, this course helps students 1) gain fluency in the R programming language, 2) effectively explore & visualize data, 3) use statistical thinking to analyze data and rigorously evaluate their conclusions, and 4) effectively communicate their results. Course objectives are accomplished through hands-on practice, using real-world data to learn via case studies, and project-based learning.

### Course Objectives

-   Program at the introductory level in the R statistical programming language

-   Employ the tidyverse suite of packages to interact with, wrangle, visualize, and model data

-   Explain & apply statistical concepts (estimation, linear regression, logistic regression, etc.) for data analysis

-   Communicate data science projects through effective visualization, oral presentation, and written reports

### Acknowledgements

I want to first recognize [Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundeland](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/) for her unparalleled efforts in support of education and educators in data science, statistics, and R programming. This course website was adapted from her [course website](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring18/Sta199/). These course slides/labs/homework...also adapted from Mine's [course](https://github.com/Sta199-S18) and the related [datascienceinabox](https://datasciencebox.org/). I am so \*very\* indebted to Mine! I also want to thank the [Open Case Studies](https://www.opencasestudies.org/) team for their tireless work in putting together interesting and topical case studies, a handful of which we use throughout the course. And, finally, thanks to [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/), whose [artwork](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/) is inspiring, educational, and fun...and is used throughout this course. Further, thanks to the R (education) community generally; planning this course was really fun because I had so many awesome resources to choose from. Having these materials made course prep and planning is just another example of what sets the R community apart!
