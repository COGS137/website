This assignment is meant to get you comfortable with 1) the format of homework assignments in this course and 2) writing R code in RStudio. The specific questions on this assignment will be simpler and should take you less time than those on future assignments. This assignment focuses on variables, operators, and datasets.

## Getting started

Here are the steps for getting started:

- Start by navigating to the hw01 GitHub URL (found on Canvas)
- Clone this repo into RStudio on datahub
- Make any changes needed as outlined by the tasks you need to complete for the assignment
- Periodically commit changes (for example, once per each new part)
- Push all your changes back to your GitHub repo
- Submit your code on Gradescope directly from GitHub

You can of course push multiple to GitHub times throughout the assignment and/or submit multiple times on Gradescope. Your final Gradescope submission will be used for grading. (This means even if you made mistakes before that submission on either GitHub or Gradescope, you wouldn't be penalized for them, so long as the final state of your work is correct).

## Questions

The `tidyverse` package will be used in this homework. Be sure to import it at the top of your RMarkdown document.

### Part 1: Variables

1. Define a variable `hw01_var` that stores an atomic vector. (The specific information stored is up to you, so long as the information is an atomic vector.)

2. Define four variables: `num_var`, `char_var`, `bool_var`, and `vector_var` that store a numeric, character, logical, and vector of length 3 type variable, respectively.

3. Define a named list `named_list` of length three where the names for each element are "First", "Last," and "Major" and the values of each are characters storing your first name, last name, and your major.

4. Execute the function that will determine how many elements there are in `named_list` (from Q3), storing the output in the variable list_length.

### Part 2: Operators

5. Three variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, and `var_c`) have been defined for you in your homework script. Using all three variables provided and any combination arithmetic operators, carry out operations that will store the numeric value `9` in the variable `output_var`.

6. Again using the variables provided for you in Q5, use any combination of those variables and logical operators to store the logical `TRUE` in the variable `true_var` and FALSE in the variable `false_var`.

### Part 3: Datasets

7. Generate a tibble `class_tibble` with three columns and two rows. The three columns should be named "First", "Last", and "Major" (in that order). The specific information stored in each of the rows is up to you. 

8. Certain packages have datasets as part of the package. For example, in `dplyr` (a package in the tidyverse), there is a dataset called `starwars`, which contains information about 87 Star Wars Characters. Using that tibble, calculate the average `height` (in cm) across all Star Wars characters' whose heights are included in the `starwars` dataset. Store this value as a "numeric" (not a tibble) in the variable `mean_height`.

9. Again using the `starwars` dataset, first, filter to only include those characters whose sex is not missing (`NA`). Then, generate a bar plot that plots the `sex` along the x axis and the number of characters corresponding to that sex on the y-axis. The x-axis should be plotted by frequency of sex (the sex that has the most characters at left and that with the fewest to the right.) Note: In the `forcats` package there is a function `fct_infreq`. We did not discuss this in class, but we did a similar example. Check out the documentation using `?fct_infreq` to learn how to use it for this question.
