## Q&A

Q: What does it mean to reorder factor levels for a tibble and why is this done to the tibble instead of in the ggplot2 part of the code?  
A: Great question - factors (which store categorical information in R) have "levels" attached to them, specifying their order. If you reorder the factor levels in the dataframe/tibble, it will reorder the levels in the dataframe directly. If you reorder factor levels in `ggplot2` it will affect the order in which the levels are displayed, but leave the tibble as it was.

Q: There are a lot of functions in R, so is there a reference sheet containing the documentation of handy functions we will commonly use?      
A: Yes! There are cheatsheets in R! For example, see the [data wrangling cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)! (see all available from Rstudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).)

Q: Something still confusing me is how we decide that we have made the most efficient visual we can. When do we know when to stop? Does this just come with practice?  
A: This is a tough one because it is subjective...and there is always "something more" you can do. But, a good heuristic is to ask yourself 1) does this visualization convey the message I'm trying to convey?, 2) Is there anything unecessary that I could remove?, and 3) Is there any way to make conveying hte message easier on my viewer. There is no "one right visualization"...which makes it hard to know when you're "done"

## Rules

1. Your solutions must be written up in the R Markdown (Rmd) file called `exam-01.Rmd`. This file must include your code and write up (written explanation) for each task. 

2. Be sure to knit your file to HTML prior to submission and include both the .Rmd and .html files on GitHub. Your "submission" will be whatever is in your exam repository at the deadline.

3. This exam is open book, open internet, closed other people. You may use any online or book based resource you would like, but you must include citations for any code that you use. You **may not** consult with anyone else about this exam. You cannot ask direct questions on the internet, or consult with each other, not even for hypothetical questions.

4. You have until **11:59pm on Monday, Oct 18th** to complete this exam and turn it in via your personal Github repo - late work will not be accepted. Technical difficulties are **not** an excuse for late work - do not wait until the last minute to knit / commit / push.

5. Each question requires a (brief) narrative as well as a (brief) description of your approach. You can use comments in your code, but do not extensively count on these. I should be able to suppress **all** the code in your document and still be able to read and make sense of your answers. See the first setup code chunk in your Rmd file to experiment with suppressing and revealing your code. 

6. Even if the answer seems obvious from the R output, make sure to state it in your narrative as well. For example, if the question is asking what is 2 + 2, and you have the following in your document, you should additionally have a sentence that states "2 + 2 is 4."

```r
2 + 2
# 4
```

7. You may only use the `tidyverse` package (and its dependencies) for this assignment. Your solutions may not use/import any other R packages.


## Academic Integrity Statement

I, ____________, hereby state that I have not communicated with or gained information in any way from my classmates or anyone during this exam, and that all work is my own.

**A note on sharing / reusing code:** We are well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. For this exam you are allowed to make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). You are also not allowed to ask a question on an external forum, you can only use answers to questions that have already been answered. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. All communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

## Getting help

Because we cannot be available to all students across the entire length of the exam, there will be no questions of instructional staff about the exam. If you find wording confusing or are unsure, note that in your answer and explain how you interpreted it. This will be taken into consideration during grading. If you are having technical difficulties, DM or email Prof Ellis immediately and she'll work with you as soon as possible.

## Grading and feedback

This exam is worth 14% of your grade. You will be graded on the correctness of your code, correctness of your answers, the clarity of your explanations, and the overall organization of your document. (There's no one "right" organization, but we should be able to easily navigate your midterm to find what we're looking for.)


## Logistics

Answer the questions in the document called `exam-01.Rmd`. Add your code and narrative in the spaces below each question. Add code chunks as needed. Use as many lines as you need, but keep your narrative concise. Be sure to knit your file to HTML and view the file prior to turning it in.

## Packages

In addition to `tidyverse`, you will need the `nycflights13` package for the data.
You will first need to install the `nycflights13` package before and loading both of them.

## The data

The `nycflights13` package contains information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in 2013.
The main data is in the `flights` data frame, but there are additional data sets which may help understand what causes delays, specifically:

-   `weather`: hourly meteorological data for each airport
-   `planes`: construction information about each plane
-   `airports`: airport names and locations
-   `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

## Questions

1.  **Question 1 (X points)** - What are the ten most common destinations for flights from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of fligts heading to each airport.

2.  **Question 2 (X points)** - Which airlines have the most flights departing from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of flights for each airline.
    In your narrative mention the names of the airlines as well.
    *Hint:* You can use the `airlines` dataset to look up the airline name based on `carrier` code.

3.  **Question 3 (X points)** - Consider only flights that have non-missing arrival delay information.
    Your answer should include the name of the carrier in addition to the carrier code and the values asked.

    a.  Which carrier had the highest mean arrival delay?
    b.  Which carrier had the lowest mean arrival delay?

4.  **Question 4 (X points)** - What was the mean temperature at the origin airport on the day with the highest departure delay?
    Your answer should include the name of origin airport, the date with the highest departure delay, and the mean temperature on that day.

5.  **Question 5 (X points)** - Consider breaking the day into four time intervals: 12:01am-6am, 6:01am-12pm, 12:01pm-6pm, 6:01pm-12am.

    a.  Calculate the proportion of flights that are delayed at departure at each of these time intervals.
    b.  Comment on how the likelihood of being delayed change throughout the day?

6.  **Question 6 (X points)** - Find the flight with the longest air time.

    a.  How long is this flight?
    b.  What city did it fly to?
    c.  How many seats does the plane that flew this flight have?

7.  **Question 7 (X pts)** - The `airports` data frame contains information on a large number of primarily American airports.
    These data include location information for these airports in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates.
    In this question we limit our focus to the [Contiguous United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States).
    Visualize and describe the distribution of the longitudes of airports in the Contiguous United States.
    What does this tell you about the geographical distribution of these airports?
    *Hint:* You will first need to limit your analysis to the Contiguous United States.
    [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States) can help, but you're welcomed to use other resources as well.
    Make sure to cite whatever resource you use.

8.  **Question 8 (X pts)** - Recreate the plot included below using the `flights` data.
    Once you have created the visualization, in no more than one paragraph, describe what you think the point of this visualization might be.
    *Hint:* The visualization uses the variable `arrival`, which is not included in the `flights` data frame.
    You will have to create `arrival` yourself, it is a categorical variable that is equal to `"ontime"` when `arr_delay <= 0` and `"delayed"` when `arr_delay > 0`.
