## Q&A

Q: I think learning about new functions/ways to find the data we want. For example, residuals, log(price), regression line, I might have missed this but  what is "set_engine". Basically what ways can we approach the data.  I'm assuming we will eventually get there  
A: Yes! We will be working on this a lot in coming weeks! But, to specifically answer what `set_engine()` is. This is a function from the `parsnip` package that allows you to 1) specify the computational approach you want to use for modelling (so far, we've only used "lm") and 2) allows you to specify the arguments you want that model to use during modelling (we'll get there).

# Background

---

## Disparities in Youth Disconnection<sup>1</sup>

.ocean[disconnected youth] - young people between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither working nor in school<sup>2</sup>

--

.ocean[claim] - "people who experience a period of disconnection as young adults go on to earn less and are less likely to be employed, own a home, or report good health by the time they reach their thirties”

--

### Known Risk Factors

There are many known risk factors, which have been identified in a variety of contexts (from family, friends, school, community, society) including:

.small[
- poverty (disconnected youth are nearly twice as likely to live in poverty and receive Medicaid)
- racial/ethnic disparities (findings suggest that these persist even when controlling for income)
- residential environment (in 2016 while 11.7% was the national average, 24% of people age 16-24 in the rural South were disconnected)
- poor academic performance
- poor mental health
- substance use disorders
- parental unemployment
- trauma exposure
- association with socially deviant peers
- school policies such as “one strike and you’re out” - which is a zero tolerance school expulsion policy and shown to increase dropouts and incarceration rates
]

---

### Known Risk Factors (cont'd)

These risk factors make it more likely for young people to miss out on education, training, and networking that can act as a foundation for a successful career.

---

### Known Consequences

- chronic unemployment
- poverty
- poor mental health and poor general health (in a 2002 study - youths disconnected for 6 or more months were 3 times more likely to develop depression or other mental health disorder)
- criminal behavior (in a 2002 study - youths disconnected for 6 or more months were 5 times more likely to have a criminal record)
- incarceration
- early mortality

# Questions

## Questions

1. How have youth disconnection rates in American youth changed since 2008?
2. In particular, how has this changed for different gender and ethnic groups? Are any groups particularly disconnected?

## Limitations

1. Survey Data ([ACS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)) - certain groups underrepresented (i.e. juvenile justice system, foster care, homeless, etc.); likely underestimates disconnection
2. Data about certain group intersections missing (i.e. LGBTQIA+)

# Data Wrangling

---

## Data Wrangling

We read the data in...but it's not in a usable format...(column names?? "\n")

```{r}
major_groups
```

---

## Cleaning up `major_groups`

```{r}
 major_groups <- major_groups |>
  stringr::str_split(pattern = "\n") |>
  unlist() |>
  tibble::as_tibble()

major_groups
```

---

### Creating Columns

.small[
- `separate` function from `tidyr`
- `sep` uses a regular expression: 
  - `?<=` "preceded by"
  - `[:alpha:]` indicates [A-Za-z]
  - `\\s` indicates a space
  - `?=` "followed by
  - altogether: any letter preceded by a space followed by a number
]
```{r}
major_groups <- 
  major_groups |>
  tidyr::separate(col = value, 
                  into = c("Group", "Years"), 
                  sep = "(?<=[[:alpha:]])\\s(?=[0-9])")
```

---

### Results after regex

```{r}
major_groups
```

.footnote[
RStudio Regex Cheatsheet]()https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf
]

---

### Cleaning up capitalization

```{r}
major_groups <- major_groups |> 
  mutate(Group = stringr::str_to_title(Group))

major_groups
```


---

### Separate Columns

```{r}
major_groups <- major_groups |> 
  tidyr::separate(col = Years, 
                  into = c("2008", "2010", "2012", "2014", "2016", "2017"), 
                  sep = " ")

major_groups
```

---

### Removing Empty Row

```{r}
 major_groups <- major_groups |> 
  tidyr::drop_na()

major_groups
```

---

### Cleaning Up Values

- decimal places missing
- data are not numeric
```{r}
major_groups <- major_groups |>
  mutate(
    across(.cols = -Group,
           ~ str_remove(string = ., pattern = "\\.")),  # remove decimal points
    across(.cols = -Group, as.numeric),  # convert to numeric
    across(.cols = -Group, ~ . * 0.1)   # get our decimal point back
  )

major_groups
```

---

### Adding variables for later

- add `Race_Ethnicity` column
- remove gender from `Race_Ethnicity` column
.small[
```{r}
major_groups  <- major_groups |>
mutate(Race_Ethnicity = dplyr::recode(Group, "United States" = "All_races",
                                      "Female" = "All_races",
                                      "Male" = "All_races"),
       Race_Ethnicity = str_remove(string = Race_Ethnicity,
                                   pattern = "Female|Male"))
```
]
---
### With New column

.small[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
DT::datatable(major_groups)
```
]
---

## Your Turn

How would you create a `Gender` column given the data we have? (Think about the logic, not necessarily the code you would write.)

.whisper[Put a green sticky on the front of your computer when you've got an idea done. Put a pink if you want help/have a question.]

--

```{r}
major_groups  <- major_groups |>
  mutate(Gender = str_extract(string = Group, 
                              pattern = "Female|Male")) |>
  mutate(Gender = replace_na(Gender, replace = "All"))
```

---

## Reshaping Your Data

.small[
`pivot_longer`:
1. `cols` - specifies what columns to collapse
2. `names_to` - specifies the name of the new column that will be created that will contain the column names of the columns you are collapsing
3 `values_to` - specifies the name of the new column that will be created that will contain the values from the columns you are collapsing

```{r}
major_groups_long <- major_groups |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = contains("20"), # any column containing 20
                      names_to = "Year",
                      values_to = "Percent",
                      names_prefix = "Perc_") |>
  dplyr::mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))
```
]

## The (Major Groups) Data!

### Adding all Asians data (from the text)

## Combining 2017 and 2018 Data!

Let's keep track of year...

## The Combine!

```{r}

## Cleaning up missing information

Some cases only have one value for a group (i.e. no male or female for Pakistani data)

Adding in NAs...

## Saving Your Data

If you save your wrangled data, you won't have to rerun all this cleaning code every time you want to work with the data...

```{r}
save(major_groups_long, asian_subgroups, latinx_subgroups, file = "data/wrangled_data.rda")

readr::write_csv(major_groups_long, file = "data/wrangled_major_groups_data.csv")
readr::write_csv(asian_subgroups, file = "data/wrangled_asian_subgroups_data.csv")
readr::write_csv(latinx_subgroups, file = "data/wrangled_latinx_subgroups_data.csv")
```
