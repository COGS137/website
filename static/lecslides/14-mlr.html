For example functions to help convert text data of currency into numeric data, or to apply a function to each element of a column. Also as an avid Python Pandas and Numpy coder, the formatting of R as using pipes (|&gt;) comes across as very unintuitive sometimes so I also think more help in R syntax and formatting would help as well.","An asynchronous portion that could be included with homework. I've noticed we keep falling behind. I am really hoping to cover some of the last topics. This supplemental material would help students get a comprehensive explanation to topics, while ensuring we don't fall behind.\n\nMaybe assign random groups for labs so students can have an easier time meeting more people to be potential group partners.","Ntohing","Have the class held in a room with access to power outlets for each student.","I think the only challenging part of the class is the workload, as the labs do take time as well and then there is usually a homework to do as well or now in the future also case studies. Maybe if the structure of the class due dates could be expanded a bit more so that we have more time to complete the homeworks that would be great (like maybe due on Wednesdays).","I just wish it wasn't 10 weeks of instruction. Just learning R takes a long time to become confident.","Hope Professor/TAs would have zoom office hours available","I would change examples where we have to recreate plots. I can never get them exactly the same as the plots we have to complete, and it shoots me down a rabbit hole. However, the concept of recreating plots is a great way to understand ggplot!","more task specific examples. (its one thing to make a ggplot once, or change something once. maybe getting more reps in before the homeworks would be nice.","Maybe explain the logic behind the Case Study 1 \"Disconnected Youth\" a little bit more.","I wish we could have more examples of the concepts and how they can be applied to different scenarios. I feel like there is a leap from what is presented in class and what we are expected to know for the homework and midterm. I had to google a lot and even then I wasn't sure how to use the info from google so I end up spending alot of time just trying to get my code to work. I also wish the code for the lecture notes were already uploaded on R studio (or we can just have a Github repo of it) so we can just run the code as we follow along in lecture, similar to what was done in COGS18. I tend to have trouble following along because I'm trying to run the code to understand how each line of code works but then most of the code builds on previous code so if I didn't have the previous code, I wouldn't be able to run the later code.","I will release the CS earlier and have more time since it is hard to get students have a time to have group meeting to discuss this. I would prefer solo but group work is vital for future work.","lab is started and due on fridays","Making the slides downloadable may be very helpful (or maybe they can be downloaded now, I just didn't figure out how)","I would make the duedates for assignments different so it is not all due at the same time.","Maybe further define the hour worth of effect on the labs or be clear in terms of what’s expected of us when turning the labs (should at least half of it be done or all of it)","Asynchronous recordings for sections","Some labs take more than an hour to complete."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Optional: If you were in charge and could change one thing about COGS 137, what would it be?<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

### Follow up to what you would change

.small[
- **Labs**: take a long time
  - We make them long so that nobody is bored in lab, *but* you typically don't have to do *everything*
  - Going to **push lab due date back to Sunday night (11:59 PM)** to take some of the pressure off.
  - *But* this does NOT mean we're expecting you to complete. Just giving additional time
  - If you feel like you're putting in ~1h of work and NOT getting full credit, reach out to Prof (DM on Campuswire or email)
]
--
.small[
- release CS earlier (I totally agree. will work on this.)
- power outlets (I also agree. I don't have a solution :( )
]
--
.small[
- need more zoom office hours
  - **new zoom office hours**: by appt. only
  - 10 min slots on Thursdays 3-4 PM 
  - see Canvas for link to sign up

## Price, surface area, and living artist

- Explore the relationship between price of paintings and surface area, conditioned 
on whether or not the artist is still living
- First visualize and explore, then model
- But first, prep the data

.midi[

```r
pp &lt;- pp |&gt;
  mutate(artistliving = if_else(artistliving == 0, "Deceased", "Living"))

pp |&gt;

## Typical surface area

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
.pull-left-narrow[
Typical surface area appears to be less than 1000 square inches (~ 80cm x 80cm). There are very few paintings that have surface area above 5000 square inches.

## Narrowing the scope

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
For simplicity let's focus on the paintings with `Surface &lt; 5000`:

]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```r
pp_Surf_lt_5000 &lt;- pp |&gt;
  filter(Surface &lt; 5000)

ggplot(data = pp_Surf_lt_5000, 
       aes(y = log_price, x = Surface, color = artistliving, shape = artistliving)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(color = "Artist", shape = "Artist") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#E48957", "#071381"))
```

## Two ways to model

- **Main effects:** Assuming relationship between surface and logged price 
**does not vary** by whether or not the artist is living.
- **Interaction effects:** Assuming relationship between surface and logged 
price **varies** by whether or not the artist is living.

---

## Interacting explanatory variables

- Including an interaction effect in the model allows for different slopes, i.e. 
nonparallel lines.
- This implies that the regression coefficient for an explanatory variable would 
change as another explanatory variable changes.
- This can be accomplished by adding an interaction variable: the product of two 
explanatory variables.

## Fit model with main effects

- Response variable: `log_price`
- Explanatory variables: `Surface` area and `artistliving`

```
]

--

`$$\widehat{log\_price} = 4.88 + 0.000265 \times surface + 0.137 \times artistliving$$`

---

## Solving the model

- Non-living artist: Plug in 0 for `artistliving`

`\(\widehat{log\_price} = 4.88 + 0.000265 \times surface + 0.137 \times 0\)`  
`\(= 4.88 + 0.000265 \times surface\)`

--
- Living artist: Plug in 1 for `artistliving`

`\(\widehat{log\_price} = 4.88 + 0.000265 \times surface + 0.137 \times 1\)`   
`\(= 5.017 + 0.000265 \times surface\)`

---

## Visualizing main effects

.pull-left-narrow[
- **Same slope:** Rate of change in price as the surface area increases does 
not vary between paintings by living and non-living artists.
- **Different intercept:** Paintings by living artists are consistently more 
expensive than paintings by non-living artists.

## Interpreting main effects

.midi[

```r
tidy(pp_main_fit) |&gt; 
  mutate(exp_estimate = exp(estimate)) |&gt;
  select(term, estimate, exp_estimate)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 × 3
##   term               estimate exp_estimate
##   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)        4.88           132.  
## 2 Surface            0.000265         1.00
## 3 artistlivingLiving 0.137            1.15
```
]

- All else held constant, for each additional square inch in painting's surface area, the price of the painting is predicted, on average, to be higher by a factor of 1.
- All else held constant, paintings by a living artist are predicted, on average, to be higher by a factor of 1.15 compared to paintings by an artist who is no longer alive.
- Paintings that are by an artist who is not alive and that have a surface area of 0 square inches are predicted, on average, to be 132 livres.

---

## Main vs. interaction effects

- The way we specified our main effects model only lets `artistliving` affect the intercept.
- Model implicitly assumes that paintings with living and deceased artists have the *same slope* and only allows for *different intercepts*.  

.question[
What seems more appropriate in this case?
+ Same slope and same intercept for both colours
+ Same slope and different intercept for both colours
+ Different slope and different intercept for both colours

## Interpretation of interaction effects

- Rate of change in price as the surface area of the painting increases does 
vary between paintings by living and non-living artists (different slopes), 
- Some paintings by living artists are more expensive than paintings by
non-living artists, and some are not (different intercept).

.small[

`\(\widehat{log\_price} = 4.91 + 0.00021 \times surface\)`

## Comparing models

---

## R-squared

- `\(R^2\)` is the percentage of variability in the response variable explained by 
the regression model.


```r
glance(pp_main_fit)$r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.01320884
```

```r
glance(pp_int_fit)$r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.0176922
```

--
- Clearly the model with interactions has a higher `\(R^2\)`.

--
- However using `\(R^2\)` for model selection in models with multiple explanatory variables is not a good idea as `\(R^2\)` increases when **any** variable is added to the model.

---

## Adjusted R-squared

It appears that adding the interaction actually increased adjusted `\(R^2\)`, so we 
should indeed use the model with the interactions.


```r
glance(pp_main_fit)$adj.r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.01258977
```

```r
glance(pp_int_fit)$adj.r.squared
```

```
## [1] 0.01676753
```

---

## Third order interactions

- Can you? Yes
- Should you? Probably not if you want to interpret these interactions in context
of the data.

---

## In pursuit of Occam's razor

- Occam's Razor states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

--
- Model selection follows this principle.

--
- We only want to add another variable to the model if the addition of that variable brings something valuable in terms of predictive power to the model.

--
- In other words, we prefer the simplest best model, i.e. **parsimonious** model.
