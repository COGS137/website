## Q&amp;A
.small[
Q: Still confused about what interaction effects means...  
A: So, a more intuitive (and common) example than what we used in class may help explain this a bit better. Imagine you're outcome variable is weight lost. Your predictors are gender (in this case, male and female) and diet (diet A, diet B). The *main effects* model would measure the effects of diet on weight lost and gender on weight lost. Here, the slopes would be the same for each gender...but the y-intercept could shift between groups, allowing the "baseline" of weight lost to differ between genders but the effect size of each diet would be the same between genders (i.e. both genders would lose 2 lbs more on diet B than diet A). *But* a model that allowed for *interaction* effects would allow for an interaction between the predictors. In this case, an *interaction between diet an gender*. This would mean, for example, that men using diet A could lose more weight than women using diet A (allowing for a different slope for the line...in addition to a different y-intercept).

## Rent in Edinburgh

.question[
Take a guess! How much does a typical 3 BR flat in Edinburgh rent for?
]

## Bootstrapping scheme

1. Take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken **with replacement** from the 
original sample, of the same size as the original sample
2. Calculate the bootstrap statistic - a statistic such as mean, median, 
proportion, slope, etc. computed on the bootstrap samples
3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - 
a distribution of bootstrap statistics
4. Calculate the bounds of the XX% confidence interval as the middle XX% 
of the bootstrap distribution

**(a)** 95% of the time the mean rent of three bedroom flats in this sample is between ¬£1603 and ¬£2213.

**(b)** 95% of all three bedroom flats in Edinburgh have rents between ¬£1603 and ¬£2213.

**(c)** We are 95% confident that the mean rent of all three bedroom flats is between ¬£1603 and ¬£2213.

## Confidence level

**We are 95% confident that ...**

- Suppose we took many samples from the original population and built a 95% confidence interval based on each sample.
- Then about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

---

## Commonly used confidence levels

.question[
Which line (orange dash/dot, blue dash, green dot) represents which confidence level? (90%, 95%, 99%)
]

## Precision vs. accuracy

.question[
If we want to be very certain that we capture the population parameter, should we use a wider or a narrower interval? What drawbacks are associated with using a wider interval?
]

.question[
How can we get best of both worlds -- high precision and high accuracy?
]

---

## Changing confidence level

.question[
How would you modify the following code to calculate a 90% confidence interval? 
How would you modify it for a 99% confidence interval?
]


```r
edi_3br |&gt;
  specify(response = rent) |&gt; 
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "bootstrap") |&gt; 
  calculate(stat = "mean") |&gt;
  summarize(lower = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

---

## Recap

- Sample statistic `\(\ne\)` population parameter, but if the sample is good, it can be a good estimate
- We report the estimate with a confidence interval, and the width of this interval depends on the variability of sample statistics from different samples from the population
- Since we can't continue sampling from the population, we bootstrap from the one sample we have to estimate sampling variability
- We can do this for any sample statistic:
  - For a mean: `calculate(stat = "mean")`
  - For a median: `calculate(stat = "median")`

Assuming that this sample is representative of all births in NC, we are 95% confident that the average length of gestation for babies in NC is between ---- and ---- weeks.
]

**(1) How many variables?**

--

1 variable: length of gestation, `weeks`

**(2) What type(s) of variable(s)?**

--

Numerical

--

**(3) What is the research question?**

## Simulation for CI for a mean

**Goal:** Use bootstrapping to estimate the sampling variability of the mean, i.e. the variability of means taken from the same population with the same sample size.

--

1. Take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken with replacement from the 
original sample, of the same size as the original sample.

2. Calculate the mean of the bootstrap sample.

3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - 
a distribution of bootstrap means.

4. Calculate the bounds of the 95% confidence interval as the middle 95% 
of the bootstrap distribution.

---

## Set a seed first

From the documentation of `set.seed`:

- `set.seed` uses a single integer argument to set as many seeds as are required. There is no guarantee that different values of seed will seed the RNG differently, although any exceptions would be extremely rare.

- Initially, there is no seed; a new one is created from the current time and the process ID when one is required. Hence different sessions will give different simulation results, by default.


```r
set.seed(20180326)
```

---

## Computation for CI for a mean


```r
boot_means &lt;- ncbirths |&gt;
  filter(!is.na(weeks)) |&gt; # remove NAs
  specify(response = weeks) |&gt;
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") |&gt;
  calculate(stat = "mean")
ggplot(data = boot_means, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.03)
```

&lt;img src="15-bootstrap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Length of gestation


```r
boot_means |&gt;
  summarise(
    lower = quantile(stat, 0.025),
    upper = quantile(stat, 0.975)
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 √ó 2
##   lower upper
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1  38.2  38.5
```

--

Assuming that this sample is representative of all births in NC, we are 95% confident that the average length of gestation for babies in NC is between 38.2 and 38.5 weeks.

---

## Length of gestation, revisited

.question[
The average length of human gestation is 280 days, or 40 weeks, from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period. Do these data provide convincing evidence that average length of gestation for women in NC is different than 40 weeks? Use a significance level of 5%.
]

--

`\(H_0: \mu = 40\)`  
`\(H_A: \mu \ne 40\)`

--

- We just said, "we are 95% confident that the average length of gestation for babies in NC is between 38.1 and 38.5 weeks".

- Since the null value is outside the CI, we would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

- But an alternative, more direct, way of answering this question is using a hypothesis test.

---

## Simulation for HT for a mean

**Goal:** Use bootstrapping to generate a sampling distribution under the assumption of the null hypothesis being true. Then, calculate the p-value to make a decision on the hypotheses.

--

1. Take a bootstrap sample - a random sample taken with replacement from the 
original sample, of the same size as the original sample.

2. Calculate the mean of the bootstrap sample.

3. Repeat steps (1) and (2) many times to create a bootstrap distribution - 
a distribution of bootstrap means.

4. Shift the bootstrap distribution to be centered at the null value by subtracting/adding the difference between the center of the bootstrap distribution and the null value to each bootstrap mean.

5. Calculate the p-value as the proportion of simulations that yield a sample mean at least as extreme as the observed sample mean.

---

## Computation for HT for a mean


```r
boot_means_shifted &lt;- ncbirths |&gt;
  filter(!is.na(weeks)) |&gt; # remove NAs
  specify(response = weeks) |&gt;
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 40) |&gt; # hypothesize step
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") |&gt;
  calculate(stat = "mean")
ggplot(data = boot_means_shifted, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.03) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 38.33, color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 40 + (40 - 38.33), color = "red")
```

&lt;img src="15-bootstrap_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Length of gestation


```r
boot_means_shifted |&gt;
  filter(stat &lt;= 38.33) |&gt;
  summarise(p_value = 2 * (n() / 1000))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 √ó 1
##   p_value
##     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1       0
```

--

Since p-value less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide convincing evidence that the average length of gestation of births in NC is different than 40.
