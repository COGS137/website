# TL;DR

Pick a dataset, any dataset...

...and do something with it. That is your final project in a nutshell. More details below.

# May be too long, but please do read

The final project for this class will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own 
choosing. The dataset may already exist, or you may collect your own data using a 
survey or by conducting an experiment. You can choose the data based on your interests 
or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for 
you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and 
beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.

## Data

In order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is important that 
you choose a manageable dataset. This means that the data should be readily accessible and large 
enough that multiple relationships can be explored. As such, your dataset must have at least 50 
observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with course staff 
first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical 
variables, and continuous numerical variables.

All analyses must be done in RStudio. If you are using a dataset that comes in a format that 
we haven't encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into RStudio as this 
can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.

*Reusing datasets from class:* Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework, lecture, and/or case studies in the class.

*Reusing datasets from the Internet:* You are certainly allowed/encouraged to use datasets from the Internet; however, note that if all the code and explanation are provided to carry out the analysis online...you want to go in a different direction

## Final Report Expectations

This final report will likely take the same format/structure as your case studies; however, we imagine that there won't be *quite* as much wrangling required for your final project for most groups.

Your case study should demonstrate that you are proficient at:
- using R to wrangle data into a usable format
- visualizing data using `ggplot2`
- carrying out meaningful analyses to answer a question of interest
- communicating quantitative results effectively 

Notes: 
- You do NOT have to apply every data wrangling and statistical procedure we learned.
- Pay attention to your presentation. Organization, coherency, and clarity count.
- A few high-quality visualizations is way better than a whole bunch of mediocre visualizations


## Final Report Sections

Your case study can be organized however you see best fit, but we'll be looking for the following general sections:

- Title
- Authors
- Background/Introduction
- Question(s)
- Data 
- Data Import
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Analysis
- Results
- Discussion of results
- Conclusion

Notes:
- discussion of limitations to your analyses/how you would improve in the future/given more time must be included
- future directions for the project should also be included


### Delivarables

Your submission should include

* RMarkdown file (formatted to clearly present all of your code and results) 
* HTML file
* Dataset(s) (in csv or RData format, in a `/data` folder; note it is OK if this is NOT the original dataset, but a smaller subset that is not too large for GitHub)

Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted.

## Tips

- You're working in the same repo as your teammates now, so merge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that’s fine! Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.

- Review the grading guidelines below and ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear.

- Make sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).

- Set aside time to work together and apart (physically).


- Teamwork: You are to complete the assignment as a team. All team members are expected 
to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group 
assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient 
contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different 
teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility 
of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in 
the assignment works.

## Getting started

Here are the steps for getting started:

- This will be completed in `project_` group repository that has been created for you and your group mates.
- Make any changes needed as outlined by the tasks you need to complete for the assignment
- Periodically commit changes (for example, once per each new part)
- Knit your final report to HTML.
- Push all your changes back to your GitHub repo
- This case study will be graded from GitHub.
